Along the way the young prince finds secrets around every corner and faces enemies who hate him because of what he is, but also finds friends where he least expects them.

Now Ryuuji, Takeshi Kawai, Kazuki Shinatora, Ishimatsu Katori, and Superstar Jun Kenzaki have to prove to not only Black Shaft, but the world, that they are truly world-class boxers before the World Tournament starts.

By her side is the android Madoka, and it is Madoka's job to track and recharge the source of Sayuka's power, the Doki Doki Dynamo. Located within Sayuka's body, the Doki Doki Dynamo can only be recharged when Sayuka experiences a high level of sexual arousal which, until recently, Madoka has been able to provide her. With unacceptably low energy levels facing them, Madoka brings in the assistance of Kyohei Yanase, a boy from Sayuka's school. Kyohei once harboured a crush for Sayuka, and his sexual prowess could not have come sooner. For now arrayed against these three defenders of the Earth is the Dielast version of the escalayer, the FM77, who is ruthless in combat, and brimming with violent desire.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

On a train ride following this incident, Takashi discovers his teacher, Misaki, getting touched by a subway groper. Strangely though, instead of getting upset, Misaki seems to be enjoying it. And much to his own surprise, Takashi does too.\n\nThus begins Takashi's journey as a pupil to his teacher in a most carnal sense when they meet on the train every morning. As he explores his desires with his teacher, Takashi becomes a more confident lover. But will his new knowledge help Takashi become closer to his beloved girlfriend? Or scare her away?",

Full of despair on the day her fiancée returns from abroad to take her away, Sanshiro watches in amazement as Momoyo and her fiancée engage in some depraved S&amp;M activities with each other and various members of the house. As time passes, Sanshiro becomes convinced that these bizarre rituals are designed to summon some sort of demon, and he takes it upon himself to stop Momoyo's fiancée from destroying the woman he loves.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
