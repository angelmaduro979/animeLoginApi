For Natsuki, one of the employed maids, it was not riches or fame that she found here—but the love and pleasure from a young student named Isami.\n\nOne day, after receiving an affectionate message, Isami decides to visit Natsuki. However, Natsuki's coworker Akiha takes a quick liking to Isami and unexpectedly becomes Natsuki's rival for his attention.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Gesicht, an android police detective of Europol, is tasked with finding the murderer of Montblanc, a retired war hero robot. Although it appears that only a robot could have committed this crime, the murder of a renowned robot rights activist casts doubts on the criminal's identity. Indeed, outside of an isolated and unexplained incident that occurred eight years ago, robots are programmed to be unable to kill human beings. However, the lack of human evidence on the crime scene and the similarity of modus operandi lead Gesicht to suspect that the two murderers might be the same being—be they man or robot.\n\nShortly after Montblanc's passing, another retired elite war robot is mysteriously eliminated. Gesicht notices a pattern in the choice of murder victim: both dead robots belonged to a group of the seven most powerful war machines ever designed. Determined to stop the murderer from eliminating the five remaining veterans, Gesicht seeks help from Atom, a cutting-edge android who resembles a human boy. The duo must now hunt down the rogue killer before the series of murders is carried on, lest the very fabric of society suffer irremediable damage.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Children beg Old Man Goichi of the water mill to tell them a story. So he tells them the story of The Two Dogs while his rice cooks. In the story, a white dog and a black dog find a piece of meat on the road, but the two greedy dogs start fighting over the meat. When they get tired of fighting, they decide to divide the meat using a ruler and saw. But then they start fighting again saying one piece is bigger than the other. Then, they ask a wise monkey to settle the issue for them. Saying that it would measure the weights for them, the sly monkey eats a little of whichever piece was larger until he eats almost all of it. Seeing the now tiny pieces of meat placed in front of them, the two dogs start crying. After finishing the story, Old Man Goichi teaches the children that if you are greedy, you will come out on the losing side.\n\n(Source: Japanese Animated Film Classics)",

She wants to draw manga about high school girls, but her storyboards are bland, her art uninspired, and her premises weak. Her concerned, exasperated editor comes up with an idea: push Chaos to be more social. So, by her recommendation, Chaos moves into a dormitory for female manga artists. She soon meets the other residents: Tsubasa Katsuki, a shounen manga artist; Ruki Irokawa, who draws erotic manga popular with women; and Koyume Koizuka, a shoujo artist who, like Chaos, has yet to be serialized. Quickly striking up a friendship with these girls, Chaos finds new inspiration for her manga and continues to grow her creativity.\n\nComic Girls is a showcase of the daily lives of these manga artists. Will Chaos finally be able to make her debut and become serialized? None of the girls know, but they will all do their best to help each other become the best artists they can be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he is not working on one of his many part-time jobs to pay his tuition, he can often be found playing the RPG game Dungeon Century, where he has cultivated a relationship with an online friend. However, when Dungeon Century shuts down, he finds out that his crush, the kind-hearted Rei Riku, and his online friend are the same person. \n\nBut in the aftermath of this revelation, Rei gets kidnapped and taken into Grave Buster, which is a new online game from the creators of Dungeon Century, forcing Suigin to enter the harsh new world of a pay-to-win game in order to save her. Gin no Guardian 2nd Season continues Suigin's quest to rescue Rei, while attempting to solve the mysteries of this strange game.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having drifted through space for millennia, the Sidonia found itself once more under attack from Gauna for the first time in a century.\n\nOnce again facing the threat of extinction, a temporary victory against the Gauna was eked out thanks to the human-Gauna hybrid Tsumugi Shiraui and ace Guardian mech pilot Nagate Tanikaze.\n\n10 years later... The people of Sidonia enjoy a brief respite. Peaceful days pass, during which Tsumugi begins to realize her feelings for Nagate, who is now celebrated as a hero of Sidonia. However, as Captain Kobayashi has always known, as long as the Gauna remain, peace cannot last.\n\nThe decision is made: a final battle, upon which rests the fate of humanity's last survivors. As the end approaches, will the crew be able to protect those they love?\n\n(Source: Polygon Pictures)",

          "synopsis": "Still threatened by the \"Titans\" that rob them of their freedom, mankind remains caged inside the two remaining walls. Efforts to eradicate these monsters continue; however, threats arise not only from the Titans beyond the walls, but from the humans within them as well.\n\nAfter being rescued from the Colossal and Armored Titans, Eren Yaeger devotes himself to improving his Titan form. Krista Lenz struggles to accept the loss of her friend, Captain Levi chooses Eren and his friends to form his new personal squad, and Commander Erwin Smith recovers from his injuries. All seems well for the soldiers, until the government suddenly demands custody of Eren and Krista. The Survey Corps' recent successes have drawn attention, and a familiar face from Levi's past is sent to collect the wanted soldiers. Sought after by the government, Levi and his new squad must evade their adversaries in hopes of keeping Eren and Krista safe.\n\nEren and his fellow soldiers are not only fighting for their survival against the terrifying Titans, but also against the terror of a far more conniving foe: their fellow humans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When school ends for the day, she likes to go to a nearly hidden zone in a park to pee and masturbate due to the adrenaline rush she gets from the possibility of being caught.\n\nOne day, Hina's boyfriend, Yonezu, follows her in secret and finds out about her depraved fetish. Displeased with the conventional sex they are having, Yonezu decides to confront his girlfriend about her public masturbation fetish after seeing how much she enjoys it. To improve their sex life, they begin to have public sex, accepting all the exciting risks that come with it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
