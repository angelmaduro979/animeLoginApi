However, new troubles loom on the horizon: a ministry official argues that the deal was not legally binding and that the Ooarai school carrier is to be decommissioned. Students and their families are frustrated with this injustice and overwhelmed with despair; it seems little can be done to save the school.\n\nTheir last glimmer of hope is a proposed match against the All-Stars University Sensha-dou team, consisting of the most talented students from all over the country. Despite Ooarai being severely outnumbered and clearly outclassed, they accept the challenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It was an all-girls' school attended only by girls from good families.\n\nOne day the school was covered by a mysterious thick fog caused by an earthquake. Orc soldiers emerged from the ominous fog.\n\nThe schoolgirls were attacked one after another by these brutes from a parallel world. The girls' resistance was futile; they were crushed by the powerful orcs. Rape and death, only tragic screams echoed through the school.\n\nWhy did it become like that!? There was no one who could answer that question...\n\n(Source: VNDB)",

However, when the Demon King is defeated and peace returns to the world, the Hero Training Program is suspended indefinitely, making it impossible for anyone to become a hero.\n\nTwo years later, Raul reluctantly works at a small electronics store called Magic Shop Leon. Though the former hero-in-training is plagued by the mundanity of working in retail, everything changes with the arrival of a new hire. Appearing at first to be just a boy with good looks, \"he\" turns out to be a female demon by the name of Fino Bloodstone. She is not just any old demon either—Raul's new coworker is in fact the daughter of the late Demon King! Handed the responsibility of training this eccentric new employee, Raul soon finds his life becoming livelier than it ever was before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Following her only lead—the missing half of his invention, the Scissor Blade—she arrives at the prestigious Honnouji Academy, a high school unlike any other. The academy is ruled by the imposing and cold-hearted student council president Satsuki Kiryuuin alongside her powerful underlings, the Elite Four. In the school's brutally competitive hierarchy, Satsuki bestows upon those at the top special clothes called \"Goku Uniforms,\" which grant the wearer unique superhuman abilities. \n\nThoroughly beaten in a fight against one of the students in uniform, Ryuuko retreats to her razed home where she stumbles across Senketsu, a rare and sentient \"Kamui,\" or God Clothes. After coming into contact with Ryuuko's blood, Senketsu awakens, latching onto her and providing her with immense power. Now, armed with Senketsu and the Scissor Blade, Ryuuko makes a stand against the Elite Four, hoping to reach Satsuki and uncover the culprit behind her father's murder once and for all. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Frustrated by this defeat, Eijun and his teammates vow to reach the national tournament once they are in high school. But everything changes when a scout unexpectedly invites him to Tokyo's prestigious Seidou High School after seeing the potential in his unusual pitching style. Encouraged by his teammates, Eijun accepts the offer, ready to improve his skills and play at a much more competitive level of baseball.\n\nHowever, now surrounded by a large number of skilled players, Eijun struggles to find his place on the team. He declares that he will one day become the team's ace, but that's only if fellow first year Satoru Furuya doesn't take the title first, with his breakneck fastballs that earn him a coveted spot on the starting roster. With the addition of these talented new players to an already powerful lineup, the Seidou baseball team aims to become the best in Japan, facing off against a number of formidable foes that stand in their way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The institute's beach volleyball coach got the surprise of his lifetime when the busty and seductive Saori Kiryuu came asking for special training to get over her embarrassment in a swimsuit. Unbeknownst to him, Saori's sister was watching the entire time, and she wants their sensei for herself. Now he must come to grips with having two very sexually charged young women in his life whilst attempting to maintain his composure as a teacher.\n\nHe's not alone in his erotic misadventures, however. The female tennis team feels strong lust towards the male team, the all-girls billiards club wants at the male manga club, and the drama organization is about to engage in a supreme orgy to help their cast members bolster their own sense of self-worth. When it comes to physical pleasure, there's something new to learn for every one of the students and faculty at this \"educational\" institute.",

In response, an international federation has designated the sun as a natural incinerator, federally establishing a treaty with the goal of first processing hazardous waste on Jupiter and forming the space environment defense force Cosmo Ecology. However, polluters evading surveillance networks continue to illegally dispose of radioactive waste directly into the sun. As a result, increased solar flare activity is on the verge of turning the Earth into a desert.\n\n(Source: ANN)",
