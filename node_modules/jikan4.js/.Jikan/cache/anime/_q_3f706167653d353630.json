With high expectations, the sect's elders believe his future will be bright; yet Tang chooses to forsake this life at the cost of obtaining the sect's forbidden lore—an action punishable by death. Tang, now content with his ascension of knowledge, sees no reason to keep on living and jumps from Hell's Peak, but little did he know that that would not be the end of his existence. \n\nIn Douluo Continent, the strong prevail and the weak perish. Each person possesses an innate spirit, some of which can be cultivated and strengthened, bestowing its user with various benefits. Those who were born with such spirits can become Spirit Masters, a profession regarded as one of the continent's most noble.\n\nTang, reincarnated into this strange world, knows only the life of a blacksmith's son. At the age of six, he takes part in the Spirit Master ceremony, and discovers his spirit is Blue Silver Grass—supposedly the world's most useless spirit. In contrast, however, he possesses strong spirit power. Now, aided by the memories of his previous life as well, Tang's future as a Spirit Master is in no way bleak.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Some Story Tellers, however, choose to interfere with the stories of others rather than write their own. These malevolent beings are known as Chaos Tellers, who seek to ruin stories by overwriting the Books of Fate.\n\nEx, Reina, Tao, and Shane were born with blank books. Ostracized by society due to this abnormality, they abandon their respective stories in search of better lives. In the vast unknown, they encounter famous fairy tale characters such as Cinderella, Momotarou, and Snow White. All the while, they work to subdue the Chaos Tellers and return peace and order to the stories.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "background": "A CG comedy virtual idol anime following the footsteps of Minarai Diva, and part of the same VIRTUAL IDOL PROJECT, Heart Algorhythm has the same quirky comedic formula with a slightly different balance towards scripted content and music. Using motion capture on the main seiyuu, Suzuki Minori and Iwai Emiri, 3D animation is subsequently created based on motion data to facilitate the actors' movements, particularly during ad-lib scenes. The series appears to be a collaborative effort between Japanese and Chinese talents, and the characters in the anime speak either Japanese or Chinese. The show was broadcast simultaneously on Nico Nico Douga and Migu Dongman, and on bilibili later, and can still be found there.",

There is always a link — called \"Prism\" — connecting the modern world and these parallel worlds, and sometimes energy and substance comes through. One day, monsters known as \"Eight\" come from a parallel world and begin attacking. Humanity begins its counterattack using a power called \"Skuld,\" which harnesses the power of tomorrow. The government gathers Skuld users into an army known as \"Norn,\" but the Eight still wreak destruction over the years. Then, a boy named Asuma who can use an ancient weapon is discovered. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Their rowdy behavior spurs the ire of Kasumi Nomura, a deadpan loner constantly teased by her older sister for her tendency to lose games. Not willing to compete, Kasumi declines Olivia's offer to join the fun, but eventually gets involved anyway and dispenses her own brand of mischief. Soon, a strange friendship blossoms between the peculiar trio, and they decide to form the \"Pastime Club,\" where they are free to resume their daily hijinks. \n\nWhether it be failing to learn English, trying desperately to become popular, or getting caught by teachers at the wrong time, school life will never be boring when the girls of Asobi Asobase are up to their hilarious antics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A young boy whose name she doesn't even know. Treasured memories of walking with him through Chichibu Shrine. Taking in the carpets of pink flowers at Hitsujiyama Park, the mountain stream at Nagatoro, the sea of clouds from Mitsumine Shrine. These are priceless moments she yearns to relive. Maybe... just maybe... if she heads to Chichibu she might see him again. Clinging to her faint hope and distant memories, Kaoruko resolves to find out.\n\n(Source: Official site)",

At the age of 4, he began his training, at 10 he already owned the ninth level of strength, and at 11 - the tenth, so he became the youngest fighter in the history of his family. But at the age of 12, something unpredictable happened: he lost almost all of his strength. For the next three years, neighbors mocked him and even broke off his engagement. It would seem that nothing will help him, but then a spirit appeared from his ring, which showed him the way to power. Xiao Yan again became a favorite of the family and the crowd, but this could not satisfy his ambition. To avenge the failed wedding, he goes to the mountains and, with the help of an old herbalist, becomes stronger and stronger.",
