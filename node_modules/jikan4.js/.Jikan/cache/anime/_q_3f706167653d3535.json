Hellbent on earning enough money to break his contract and return to Japan, Shin has managed to become one of the most lethal pilots at the base known as Area 88. But having spent so much time in a place where one's life is always in jeopardy, will Shin remain the same man if and when he can return to the civilian world?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead, they take to the skies and travel across the universe on the Galaxy Railways, transporting mankind from planet to planet. However, the Galaxy Railways are no safer than traditional trains: criminals, terrorists, and vile aliens always find a way to stir up trouble. \n\nManabu Yuuki, a rash and hot-headed man, is the latest addition to the Galaxy Railways' elite Space Defence Force (SDF). These brave men and women are responsible for protecting the railways and responding to any unprecedented danger, risking their lives to protect the innocent from evil. But as this drama unfolds and the SDF's greatest crisis draws nearer, Manabu must truly learn what it means to be a member of the SDF before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

An impoverished boy, Tetsurou Hoshino, desires to purchase a pass on the Galaxy Express 999—a train that travels throughout the universe—because it is said that at the end of the line, those aboard can obtain a mechanical body for free. When Tetsurou's mother is gunned down by the villainous machine-man hybrid Count Mecha, however, all seems lost.\n \nTetsurou is then saved from certain death by the mysterious Maetel, a tall woman with blonde hair and a striking resemblance to his mother. She gives him a pass to the Galaxy Express under one condition: that they travel together. Thus, Tetsurou begins his journey across the universe to many unique planets and thrilling adventures, in hopes of being able to attain that which he most desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A decade later, the vampire war hero Jirou Mochizuki, known as the \"Silver Blade,\" travels with his younger brother Kotarou to the Special Zone—a safe haven where vampires and humans live in harmony.\nHowever, their journey is suddenly faced with danger when a conflict erupts between vampire migrants and human forces from the Special Zone. With the rise of a developing conspiracy from an old enemy, Jirou will need the help of his new ally, Mimiko \"Compromiser\" Katsuragi, as well as the power of his ancient bloodline to protect what he treasures the most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But before she is officially crowned as queen, she must restore balance to the universe that has come to favor darkness. To accomplish her goal, Tsunami gives the ordinary Sasami Kawai a magical baton that can transform her into a magical girl. She also appoints the rabbit-like creature Ryou-Ouki to aid Sasami in the battle against evil.\n\nHowever, Sasami refuses to become a magical girl—not because she is scared, but because she finds it too embarrassing! Meanwhile, the arrogant Ramia is plotting to overthrow Tsunami by enlisting her own magical girl—the eccentric Pixy Misa—to cause chaos and ensure that balance is never restored. As Pixy Misa terrorizes the planet with her Love-Love monsters, Sasami must learn to swallow her pride and accept her role as the universe's champion of justice, Pretty Sammy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Fifteen years ago in a barren stretch of the Pacific, a cruise ship collided with an iceberg and was lost at sea. More than a decade later, Hideto Yashiro—a ship engineer—died in a fatal car accident. The unlikely connection between these events only comes to light on the luxury liner St. Aphrodite during her maiden voyage.\n\nAboard it on a much needed vacation, Kogorou Mouri, his daughter Ran, Conan Edogawa, and the Detective Boys enjoy a trip provided by Sonoko Suzuki's family. But their fun is soon cut short when a game of hide-and-seek leads to Sonoko's disappearance. Some time later, the CEO of the Yashiro group, who built the St. Aphrodite, is found stabbed to death and her father missing. While the police's investigation turns to a dead end, Conan closes in on the culprit. Unwilling to be apprehended, the culprit threatens to blow up the St. Aphrodite and sink all her passengers.\n\nAs the ship's hull rapidly fills with water, the truth behind the vengeful murders is finally revealed. With no place to escape, Conan and Kogorou must wrestle with the elusive culprit before everyone on board is dragged to the ocean floor.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Nina Yamada's greatest dream is to find someone that will protect her in the same way the princesses are in her storybooks. She soon desperately needs that protection: when she swallows a strange pink ball of what she believes to be hard candy, a huge number of people fall from the sky. The ball she swallowed is the Crystal Pearl, a symbolic trinket that magic users from another world fight over. The winner of the Crystal Pearl passes a magic exam that can grant them the prestigious title of professional wizards.\n\nZero and Ichii, two young men taking the exam together, quickly determine that the pearl is inside Nina and promise to protect her until the exam is over. With countless other examinees after the object, their task is daunting—but not as brutal as the embarrassment Nina faces when she arrives at school with two handsome boys at her heels.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After studying the mating behaviors of Earthlings, she decides to enlist the help of one of her research subjects, college student Yoshizumi, but crash-lands on his roof. Taken hostage and shot with her own gun by Yoshizumi, she is brainwashed into thinking she is his younger sister. Fortunately, Yoshizumi grows fond of Mayuka and decides to help her with her mission: to awaken the powers of Akiho--the red-haired, green-eyed, appetite-driven Ultimate Weapon--using \"primitive stimulation\".\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Masaki may be a slacker, but he's quick to realize that the fastest way to collect is to go after the debtors' hot, busty daughters! \nAnd so, Masaki's \"game\" begins. The rules? If the girls can't pay back the debt, they have pay up with all sorts of sexual favors. They'll have to cater to his every carnal demand, fulfill his every fetish... Masaki may not be collecting much money, but he doesn't care – he's surrounded by girls moaning in pleasure and begging for more!\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
