Without any memories, he is utterly lost until he stumbles upon Kuon—a young girl with animal ears and a tail. She saves him, leading him back to her town while protecting them both from \"boro-gigiri\"—giant centipede-like creatures—and a mysterious red slime. After they arrive, she names him Haku after a prominent historical figure from the area. He quickly realizes he is one of a kind—the only one without animal ears and a tail. The two journey to the capital of Yamato, the country in which Kuon lives, meeting more people and making new friends, all the while unknowingly delving deeper into the politics and inner conflicts of Yamato...\n\nUtawarerumono: Itsuwari no Kamen follows Haku as he slowly uncovers the secrets of this alien world. He works to solve the mysteries surrounding the red slimes, as well as to stop war from erupting among the nearby countries.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The Celestial Records speak of the existence of the \"Seraphim,\" a race of divine beings who give blessings to humanity and are offered prayers by them in return. Those who are anointed with the ability to interact with these spirits are known as \"Shepherds.\" Hailed as heroes for their prompt appearances in times of crisis, while also being feared for their power, the Shepherds are imprinted in common folklore along with the Seraphim.\n\nSorey is a young human who has spent his entire life living in harmony alongside the Seraphim in the village of Elysia. Fascinated by the myths of the Celestial Records, he explores some nearby ruins with Mikleo—his childhood Seraphim companion—hoping to enlighten himself about the Seraphims' history with mankind.\n\nUnfortunately, they become trapped in the depths of the historical site during their investigation. While searching for an exit, they come across a mysterious girl who desperately seeks the help of a Shepherd to save the world, which is on the brink of being consumed by darkness. Despite Mikleo's warning about making contact with other humans, Sorey decides to help the stranger, which unknowingly leads him closer to the dream of peaceful coexistence between man and Seraphim.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On a swing in a park, he meets up with Hiyori Asahina, who gently strokes the cat in her arms. However, when the cat leaps away, Hiyori runs headlong into a never-ending tragedy—and Hibiya will do whatever it takes to see her safe.\n\nHeadphone Actor\n\"The end of the world is nigh,\" the news broadcast proclaims. Amidst the chaos, Takane Enomoto hears a voice in her headphones, asking if she wants to live. Following its directions, she races onward, but what awaits her may not be the salvation that she desires.\n\nSouzou Forest\nDue to her red eyes and white hair, everybody sees Mari Kozakura as a monster. Although she lacks the courage to do so, she dreams of escaping her house in the forest where she lives alone, imagining the world outside. Fortunately, her lonesome life begins to change with a simple knock on the door.\n\nKonoha no Sekai Jijou\nThe android-like being Konoha lacks many memories. What he recalls are feelings of longing, but by who and for who, he cannot place. What he does know, however, is that in the heat haze of summer, a young boy and girl face a tragedy. But fate is unchangeable, and his desperate attempts to save them can never seem to rewrite the future.\n\nToumei Answer\nShintarou Kisaragi knows how every day will go. Blessed with a photographic memory, he knows he will score full marks on his next exam, and he knows that Ayano Tateyama, the girl who sits next to him, will do poorly. But with his genius also comes unrelenting boredom; not even Ayano's bright smile and optimistic outlook can make him waver. His apathy may finally be broken, however, when Ayano does something that shakes Shintarou to his very core.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Most of the Earth has been contaminated and is collapsing into ruin, and a great majority of plants and animals are now extinct. The world heads to the \"Big Six,\" the sixth mass extinction event. Humanity built cities in the sky, migrating the endangered species of animals and plants there. Over many years, the animals evolved in these isolated cities. With artificial genetic crossbreeding, they acquire language, bipedality, and build a life and civilization for themselves free from want. No one thinks of the world below any longer. One day, a single plant seed wanders into one of the sky cities, and the children Kui, Hiruma, and Root discover it. Unable to resist the temptation to look into the world outside, they decide to undertake an adventure to the outside world, unknowing that once they set foot on the ground, they will never be able to return.\n\n(Source: MAL News)",

          "synopsis": "As a new student, Eruna Ichinomiya meets various strangers, learns about their clubs, and helps them with their problems.\n\nHoukago Stride\nEruna was hardly prepared to go to her new school, but that's no matter. Leading it off with an enormous stride, she will hop, step, and jump her way through, showing her unparalleled motivation and optimistic outlook. One, two, three—she'll shout out her excitement with the fire of a toy gun! \n\nMukiryoku Coup d'Etat\nAs an actor, Yuuto Akama is accustomed to playing different roles, and real life is just another one of these. He wears a practiced smile and a carefree attitude, but inside, a war is waging. A personality squashed and imprisoned... Yuuto puts down the coup d'état of his former self, all to maintain his perfect facade. But no matter how much time passes, the memories don't disappear, and he can never stop the flames of rebellion of his heart.\n\nUchouten Vivace\nWith a cheerful hop and skip, Himi Yasaka shows Eruna all the fun and excitement of the Calligraphy Club. It's a rhythmic and all-encompassing art; although calligraphy may take a bit of practice, anyone can do it. All you need is an ecstatic vivace!\n\nGarakuta Innocence\nNo matter what saturation, contrast, or hue, painter Kyouma Kuzuryuu cannot create a work that is good enough. Everything, including himself, always falls short. He lies to himself that this is what he always wanted, but in the end, he is still another piece of trash. Is there any salvation for the lonesome and self-deprecating Kyouma?\n\nIzayoi Seeing\nAsuhi Imizu has lived his life secluded from others. Gazing at the night sky through his telescope, he draws new constellations in his mind. However, like the sun after a rainstorm, Eruna brightens his life, helping him open up to others. Together, they view a 16-day-old moon; all the while, Asuhi is guided by her light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
