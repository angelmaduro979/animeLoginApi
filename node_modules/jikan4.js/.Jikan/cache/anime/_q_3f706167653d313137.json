A 20-year trip passes, and the traveler has only aged 1 year. It definitely has its advantages, but after you've been on a few trips, it sure gets very lonely.\n\nRight now, however, that's not the big issue. The year is 2264. The Syncam Corporation has sent the Saldes and its crew of 13 (and 1 cat) out into deep space to explore the potential of a newfound planet 20 years away. Soon after they awaken from their stasis, however, things are happening one after another. First, the crew learns that two of the crew are not who they claim to be. Then, one by one, crewmembers die suddenly. Then, the ship begins to turn against them. And as if it couldn't get any worse, they find another mess on their hands and it is ugly.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a simple exploratory mission has become a struggle for survival in the depths of space. 20 years from home, they're all alone and no one can hear them scream.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

The story follows Haseo, a player in the online MMORPG called The World:R2 at first depicted as a PKK (Player Killer Killer) known as the \"Terror of Death\", a former member of the disbanded Twilight Brigade guild. Haseo encounters Azure Kite (believing him to be Tri-Edge and blaming him for what happened to Shino) but is hopelessly outmatched. Azure Kite easily defeats Haseo and Data Drains him, reducing his level from 133 to 1 and leaving him without any items, weapons, or member addresses. He is left with a mystery on his hands as to the nature of the Data Drain and why Azure Kite is in possession of such a skill.\n\nEventually Haseo gains the \"Avatar\" of Skeith. Acquiring the ability to call Skeith and wield his abilities, such as Data Drain. With Skeith as his strength, Haseo begins the quest for a way to save Shino.\n\nHe is seen seeking out a PK (Player Killer) known as Tri-Edge, whose victims supposedly are unable to return to The World after he PKs them. Haseo's friend, Shino, was attacked six months prior to the events of the game by Tri-Edge, and the player herself, Shino Nanao, was left in a coma.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The phenomenon is so big that an entire city was built for the racing industry where competitions take place on a huge track. In the “Immortal Grand Prix,” two teams of three IG machines, high-tech humanoid mechs driven by humans, race at speeds greater than 400km/h. The teams make three laps of a 60 km course while intercepting the opponent as they vie for a first place finish. The best machine performance, the best pilots and the best teamwork are the only factors that can make them the winners.\n\n(Source: Production I.G.)",

It was released in Japan on July 14, 1984 and is set after the 21st Choujin Olympics Arc. This was the first movie to feature seiyuu Kouji Yada, who appears in all following movies (except the final two), and also the first to feature series creators Yudetamago in a cameo. Octopus Dragon, Harigoras, and Ukon are all kaijuu from the infamous \"Roots Island\" two-part story from the original manga that does not appear in recent reprints. Tigerian is also a kaijuu from the original manga, although these characters bear little resemblance to their manga counterparts. The movie's monster Gigasaurus does resemble the manga's Octopus Dragon. (Source: Wikipedia)",

In Edo Japan, a villain called Shuten Douji (朱天童子) is threatening to destroy the Earth if he is not given Princess Mari. Always willing to impress a pretty girl, Kinnikuman immediately vows to destroy Shuten Doji. He disguises himself as Princess Mari and goes to meet Shuten Doji, but Shuten Doji and his Big Four (四天王, Shitennou) see through Kinnikuman's disguise and beat him up. Aware of Kinnikuman's situation, Terryman, Robin Mask, and the other Seigi Choujins travel to Edo Japan (via Kinkotsu-obaba's powers).\n\n(Source: Kinnikuman Wiki)",

One day, her favorite mirror which was given to Akko by her mother (or in some versions, by her father, as a present from India) is broken, and she prefers to bury it in her yard rather than throw it to the trash can. In her dreams, she is contacted by a spirit (or in some cases the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom) who is moved that the little girl would treat the mirror so respectfully and not simply throw it away. Akko-chan is then given the gift of a magical mirror and taught an enchantment that will allow her to transform into anything she wishes.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
