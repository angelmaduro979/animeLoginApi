An ancient race of aliens, seeing that there was no other intelligent life in the Universe, set their massive supercomputers the task of seeding more races that could grow to sentience. The project was known as the Omega Program. The human race was the result of this project.\n\nHowever, humans were not the only races to grow from the Omega Program, and lurking in the future is the deadliest threat the human race has ever faced. In time, the products of this Program are destined to clash in violent opposition. Hopelessly outnumbered by the technologically superior enemy, Earth has one last hope—the secret fail-safe of the Omega Program—the Delta Boy, living avatar of the supercomputer that began life on Earth.\n\nHis only problem is staying alive long enough to save his future—and that of all humanity...",

But when he sees the patron of his orphanage, Keisei Tagami, seemingly revive the scarred corpse of schoolgirl Makina Hoshimura, he cannot help but feel incredibly shocked.\n\nIntrigued by the mysterious circumstances surrounding Makina, he learns that she is a Shikabane Hime—an undead being tasked with eliminating others like her who pose a threat to society. As Ouri goes about his daily life, his inexplicable run-ins with her are shrouded in abnormality. But as each encounter grows more intense, the two are brought closer together, and it may be their intertwining fates that hold the key to unveiling the secrets behind the world of Shikabanes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He and his stepmother decide to give it a try. The game requires drawing cards from a deck that have sexual instructions on them. Though it starts out innocently enough, Yuji soon experiences sexual feelings for his opponent. As the game progresses and the sexual tension escalates, it culminates in a sexual free-for-all with his stepmother and stepsister. \n\n(Source: Boxtorrents)",

Other team members included a dog, a boar, a deer, a koala, a mouse, a seagull, and a lion. The animals would win a prize for completing a mission, as would the viewers, who were encouraged to write in and guess which of the creatures would save the world by each Friday (a single mission stretched over a week of TV). Created by Mitsuru Kaneko, this show was given a limited broadcast on some American local TV stations for the Japanese community.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)",
