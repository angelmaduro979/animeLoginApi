          "synopsis": "Young detective Sonia Summers has been transferred to the outskirts of the port city Libra after stirring up trouble with her superiors. Libra is separated into two sectors—\"the Upper,\" the center of wealth and politics, and \"the Outside.\" The Outside is home to crime, corruption, and curious incidents involving monstrosities or youkai. Each case that Sonia works on seems to implicate the involvement of these mysterious creatures.\n\nSonia crosses paths with three peculiar humanoid youkai—Bem, Bela and Belo—who seek to protect humans and fight against the evil youkai that terrorize them. Living as \"Youkai-Ningen,\" they are excluded by other youkai for their human-like lifestyles, and rejected and hurt by humans when they reveal their true forms.\n\nDespite the hardships they face, these three Youkai-Ningen secretly live among humans, continuing to pursue their dreams of one day becoming human as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Best friends Yuu, Haru, and Kotona enjoy a tranquil high school life together. One day, however, a suspicious man pursues and stabs Kotona—a catastrophe that Yuu and Haru fail to prevent. While hastily carrying the girl to the hospital, the two boys are nearly hit by a truck but miraculously remain unharmed. Instead, they find themselves in a fairy-tale-like kingdom with an exotic diversity of people and wonderful creatures.\n\nTo their surprise, the boys discover that Yuu, who has been confined to a wheelchair since childhood, can now walk! Yet they have no time to ponder the puzzling situation, as their friend is gone. Setting off to find Kotona, Yuu and Haru stop at a local pub to inquire about her. But upon inspecting a picture of Asha, the kingdom's princess, the two have a shocking revelation.\n\nNarrating an extraordinary adventure in a magical world, Ni no Kuni demonstrates the special connection between two separate yet parallel worlds and its manifestation of the bonds between individuals.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Released in Japan on August 23, 2019 and on Netflix worldwide on January 16, 2020, Ni no Kuni is an anime adaptation of the acclaimed video game series of the same name. Studio Ghibli contributed character designs and other components to the games, but it is notably not associated with the movie, despite its similar visual tones and textures. Ni no Kuni was the first feature-length work directed by Studio Ghibli's animator Yoshiyuki Momose, who has served as the director of animation in addition to having drawn character designs and storyboards for the games. Moreover, the film features a score from Studio Ghibli's collaborator and composer Joe Hisaishi, who has also acted as the lead composer for the games' music. While the film's narrative differs from the plot in the games, the movie's story includes elements from the games such as the setting, racial diversity among the characters, names, and visual references to particular individuals and items.",

Nome Tatsunagi has Suiko summon him to the mansion where they learn he can see a Dark Tower called Sanctuary.

On one such day, however, a massive landslide is spotted on the hill where Kobayashi and Tooru first met—a clear display of a dragon's might. When none of the dragons they know claim responsibility, the perpetrator herself descends from the skies: Ilulu, the radical Chaos Dragon with monstrous power rivaling that of Tooru.\n\nSickened by Tooru's involvement with humans, Ilulu resorts to the typical dragon method of resolving conflict—a battle to the death. Despite such behavior, she becomes intrigued by Kobayashi's ability to befriend dragons and decides instead to observe just what makes Kobayashi so special. With a new troublesome dragon in town, Kobayashi's eccentric life with a dragon maid is only getting merrier.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Tong Tong (based on a real panda at Ueno Zoo of the same name who became the first giant panda to successfully be birthed in captivity Japan) and You You (Tong Tong's male sibling born 2 years after her) get scolded by Lion-sensei at school. At night a fire occurs due to a candle left lit and the fire brigade comes to put out the blaze. Tong Tong and You You learn about fire safety and the next day at school a blaze also occurs. The duo use their newly learnt knowledge and call 119 so that the fire brigade can come save their school.\n\nThis educational short was in part made in honor of the 20th anniversary of the \"Normalization of the Sino-Japanese Relations\" (1972) where pandas were temporarily exchanged.",
