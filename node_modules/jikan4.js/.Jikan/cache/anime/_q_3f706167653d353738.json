Furthermore, they are now separated into different classes, and as a result, their free time together is shortened. Looking back, their joyful times together seem like nothing more than an unachievable fantasy when their members are too occupied to even gather in Arisa Ichigaya's basement for practice sessions. As the band ponders over the situation, an unfamiliar girl suddenly emerges, unknowingly pulling them into the spotlight once more.\n\nIn this rising era of girl bands, Afterglow, Pastel*Palettes, Roselia, and Hello, Happy World! begin to make their appearance as well. Each band, comprised of musicians with their unique personalities, illuminates the stage with its performances. As Poppin'Party returns to the music scene and encounters new friends, the sparkling, heart-pounding music starts to play once again!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The two children are suddenly teleported back to August 1, 1945--the same date as the Nagaoka air raid.\n\nThe Nagaoka Fireworks Festival was founded in 1946. The event is in remembrance of those who died in WW2, specifically with the three shiragiku (white chrysanthemum fireworks) launched. The anime itself was commissioned by the foundation that organizes the Nagaoka Fireworks Festival. In 2003 and onward, the fireworks officially starts at 10:30pm, the same time the bombing began; and the duration of the short is 10min30sec long as well to mirror this very important time.",

A 'full' version was released the following year but contains very little recycled footage, essentially giving her two significantly different debut videos. \n\nThe main purpose of Midori-chan is to promote the Myslot (マイスロ) app which allows people to register their gaming through their mobile device which uses QR Codes to let players see and archive their gaming statistics. It also allows users to win prizes, be ranked against others, play minigames (in the app), collect trophies, and find fellow pachinko friends.\n\nMidori-chan has also gone on to have her own digital 4-koma manga (2 different ones), LINE stickers, a book, and apparel line.",

Endo Hiroko is the author, who was inspired to write the story from a tale her father told her as a child.\n\nIt follows a 13 year old girl named Aki. During a pilgrimage to Sensou-ji (a Buddhist temple located in Asakusa, Tokyo), she found a mistake in the sangaku. News spread quickly of her intellect and eventually landed upon Arima Yoriyuki, the lord of the Kurume Domain (he himself was famous for finding the rational approximation of pi). He hired Aki to become an arithmetic teacher for the region's princess, but hired others as well. In a math competition, Aki fought against other geniuses and prodigies, all for the hopes of earning a wage so that she may one day open a school for poor children so that she can teach them arithmetic as well.",

The video game has been adapted to a Nintendo Switch port for western audiences, whilst the card game is released under the name \"Dragon Ball Super TCG\" and is combined with the other card game of the same name in japan. The anime is expected to be short and it is not expected to broadcast on TV. It has adapted the game's Prison Planet Arc, as long as the manga original arc \"Big Bang Mission\" and \"Ultra God Misson\", also fully detailed in the Heroes manga published in Saikyou Jump, although under 2 separate canons. They have never been published officially in English. The first episode debuted July 1, 2018 at Aeon Lake Town.",

Separately, they confront the truths left unsaid for 10 years—about the band September, to which Jiang Xiaobai and Mu Xiyu dedicated their youth; about the love triangle between Jiang Xiaobai, Mu Xiyu, and Tong Li; and about the painful circumstances that brought the trio together and ultimately led to the terrible tragedy that occurred on the day Tong Li left for America. At the end of it all, can Jiang Xiaobai and Tong Li accept the past and face the future together?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

A shape begins to take form beside the board—this figure is the masked Storyteller, who once again starts to spin tales of horror and despair.\n\nThe events described in these macabre tales might happen to anyone, even your neighbors or friends: a group of girls bully one of their members in a cave, only to find themselves the victims of a dark presence; a boy with scopophobia moves to the countryside, but he still cannot escape the eyes of others; a man has a window that won't stay closed, and is the recipient of strange phone calls; and a salaryman steals an umbrella on a rainy day, but this seemingly insignificant act leads to consequences he never expected. Visitors may enjoy the Storyteller's offerings, but they should also be vigilant so that they don't wind up as the subjects of his next story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Worse yet, Captain Haruo Sakaki's refusal to sacrifice his humanity has come under fire from the remaining Bilusaludo troops, who blame him for their defeat. In their darkest moment, the few surviving humans turn to the religion of the Exifs, which promises that devotion is the path to salvation from Godzilla.\n\nHowever, the Exif are not what they seem. As the survivors become more and more zealous in their devotion, Sasaki wonders what exactly the priest Metphies is hiding—especially regarding his relationship with the monster known as Ghidorah.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
