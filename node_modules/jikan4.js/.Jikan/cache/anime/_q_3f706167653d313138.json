The interest of expanding the empire came as a result of the power-hungry General Ozmel who overthrew the current reigning Queen Medusa of the Ganymede System as a start of their universal conquest.\n\nAlmost completely succumbed to the empire, Earth is at its last days, and one scientist, Dr. Shikishima, had only one hope in restoring Earth from its alien conquerors--- a massive mecha known as the Mechander Robo, specially programmed and designed to battle these invading aliens from complete takeover of Earth.  Along with this awesome fighter machine, Dr. Shikishima also recruited three pilots to be placed behind the Mechander Robo's controls--- the mysterious Jimmy Orion, the scientist's son Ryosuke Shikishima, and Kojiro Hachijima.\n\nAlthough the primary storyline is Earth battling the Doron Empire, there is something within lead pilot Jimmy Orion's past that was somewhat connected towards the entire storyline.",

He just can't figure out why that is, as he sits down to play his favorite video games like Magical Girl Lape-chan. One day a beautiful Goddess named Fauna appears before him, not to grant wishes, but to destroy him! It seems Kousuke has the power of an evil demon sleeping inside of him. Luckily, Fauna decides on an alternate means of stopping the demon, which involves lots of sex with her and sexy older sister (and love potion maker) Jordh. Unluckily, there's Natsuki, a little devil with plans of her own for Kousuke. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

These cyborgs, dubbed the Meganoids, soon ran out of control and killed Dr. Haran along with his whole family, save his youngest son, the 16-year-old Banjou Haran. Banjou escapes from Mars on a rocket with a solar-powered super robot called Daitarn 3, which was built with the special metals of Mars. Now eighteen years old and living on Earth in a luxurious mansion, Banjou fights against the Meganoids with the aid of his faithful butler Garrison and his two gorgeous companions Reika and Beauty. Together they must stop the evil Meganoids which aspire to turn all humans into cyborgs and thus \"improve\" the human race.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Not only is Arale severely nearsighted, but she also has no common sense! At least she has super-strength, though that often proves to be a setback as well. \n\nAlthough she means well, Arale only causes trouble for her neighbors in the whimsical Penguin Village!",

The young woman slowly gets accustomed to the outside world thanks to the warmth of her loving family and caring boyfriend Takayuki Narumi—who broke up with the girlfriend he had made during Haruka's hospitalization so that he could pursue his former love.\n\nHowever, afraid to be a burden to Takayuki, Haruka suggests breaking up with him and then abandons him in a departing train. More determined than ever to start a career in picture book writing, Haruka devotes herself to studying for the university admission exam. At the same time, Takayaki tries to land a stable job despite the lasting economic depression. Although they pursue seemingly different goals, will Takayuki and Haruka be able to ultimately reunite?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Miho loves to design clothing, but her aunt and three cousins don't believe that such a young girl is capable and mock her designs. Meanwhile, a contest for the new \"Disco Queen\" is coming up, and Miho wants nothing more than to be able to design a dress for someone to wear to the competition, since she's too young to enter herself. With determination and a little bit of magic, Miho's dreams just might come true!",
