          "synopsis": "In the year 2311 AD, a world that once saw itself full of inter-continental conflict now stands unified, led by the Earth Sphere Federation (ESF). The ESF established a preventative military task force known as the A-Laws, tasking them with shutting down violent terrorist organizations. As they gain more and more legal authority, the A-Laws begin to twist the law to fit their own agenda, ruling the citizens of Earth with a heavy hand.\n\nIn response to the fascistic behavior of the A-Laws, the anti-terrorist group Celestial Being reappears. Led by state-of-the-art mobile suits known as Gundam, the pilots of Celestial Being wage a new war with the A-Laws, aiming to stop their tyrannical abuse of power.\n\nSetsuna F. Seiei, pilot of the Gundam Exia, helps to lead the charge along with his fellow Gundam Meisters Lockon Stratos, Allelujah Haptism, and Tieria Erde. But in the process, Setsuna stumbles upon a conspiratorial plot spearheaded by a new faction, the Innovators, and must contend with his own old wounds and ghosts of the past in order to save a world that despises him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Undergoing a dangerous augmentation process, Dr. Kazuki's daughter Mai becomes the pilot of \"Mighty\" or \"Magnetman Minus\". Takeshi Houjou becomes the pilot of \"Puraiza\" or \"Magnetman Plus\". \n\nThe pilots would hold each other and then physically trasform their joint bodies in a metallic plate locking itself on the Gakeen (Short for \"Gathering Keen\") robot's frame thus enabling the super robot to move and fight. This sequence was notable, to an adult's eye, for its almost-sexual connotation.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "synopsis": "As the season changes to spring and flowers begin to bloom, there is one thing humanity looks toward in dread. Yes, the ever troublesome pollen allergy season has come to defile its victims once more, but it's not their noses that are being blown.\n \nThrough the miracles of evolution, the reproductive process of plants no longer yield the tiny yellow grains that stimulate the nose. Instead, they now produce beautiful girls and boys that float joyfully through the air, stimulating other areas of the body instead, whether willing or not. Moans of ecstasy and frenzy reverberate across the world from those desperate to seek relief from their relief.\n \nAlthough the streets run white with bodily fluids, people are far from relieved of their sexual troubles; fortunately, it is the perfect time to search for solutions! Inspiration can be found around every corner as encounters with the pollinic beings expose both hidden feelings and alluring physicality. Regardless of the climax that each person reaches, one thing is for sure—no amount of tissues will be enough for this allergy season.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Meanwhile, the kickboxing club Roma belongs to is about to close because Roma is the only member and thus cannot take part in team tournaments. However, Roma isn`t concerned, and draws a nude picture of Misaki during his supplementary art class. When he beats up a stalker, the grateful Misaki begins to seduce him. On the other hand, Tamaki begins to be unsatisfied with their relationship as mere childhood friends.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

The first two were released on DVD bundled with two drama CDs, with the third being sold separately. It is unknown if these will ever be released outside of Japan.\n\nThe first OVA is a re-enactment of the first chapter, where Negi first learns of his job as a teacher and is introduced to the students of Mahora Academy 2-A. It ends with profiles of the Baka Rangers (Asuna, Makie, Yue, Ku Fei and Kaede) as well as Ayaka. Asuna is the only girl in the class that doesn't have romantic feelings for Negi.\n\nThe second OVA is a re-enactment of the \"love potion\" incident of chapter 2, with profiles at the end of Nodoka, Konoka, the cheerleaders (Misa, Madoka, Sakurako) as well as Kazumi.\n\nThe third OVA is a re-enactment of chapter 13: Negi's Mahora tour with the Narutaki twins. The tour shows Negi to several of the students (Yuna, Akira, Chao, Satsuki, Satomi, Chizuru, Natsumi, Zazie) as well as others that he ends up missing (Sayo, Evangeline, Chachamaru, Chisame, Misora, Ako). After being chewed out by Haruna for completely skipping her, a final scene introduces Setsuna and Mana, keeping watch from something on campus.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

With a determination of steel, she approaches his associates in genetic research for help. However, the cost for the project requires an enormous amount of money...\n\nTo finance the project, Mai takes a very unique job - a DNA Hunter. It's their job to obtain semen samples for women who desire children by particular men - in any way necessary! (Talk about a job!) But before Mai will be accepted into this elite group, she must first undergo a test: pick a random stranger and obtain his semen.\n\nCan she do it? Will she be able to pass the test? Can she sleep with other men and become a DNA Hunter to keep her dream of having Youji's baby...? \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Trying to think of a way to bring the wooden statue to school, Jin believes that the rest of the day will be spent admiring his work. But before he can even lift it, the sculpture begins to absorb the earth around it and explodes into a cute girl!\n\nThe girl, Nagi, who introduces herself as a guardian of the earth, proclaims that Jin must help her get rid of the \"impurities\" that plague the land. But alas, due to Nagi's tree being cut down and her powers completely drained, she finds herself cleansing the impurities with only a magical wand! With their lives now intertwined, Jin and Nagi find ways to learn more about one another through the endless amounts of daily antics.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
