          "synopsis": "In the distant future, mankind has left Earth to reside among the vast reaches of space, joining the interspecies collective known as the Space Federation. Following this development, the Soviet Security Force (SSF) was formed to establish humanity's presence throughout the galaxy. Among the SSF's many divisions is the Special Armored Company (SAC) #101. Using powerful mobile humanoid weapons called \"Armored Knights,\" these female enforcers dispense justice upon corrupt officials, crime lords, and other villainous forces threatening public order.\n\nSoukou Kijo Iris follows Iris Rebel, a lieutenant of SAC #101, as her squad investigates reports of trafficking activities on the planet Left. After her Elven partner Mei Li Naceri suddenly goes missing in action, Iris narrowly escapes an ambush and loses consciousness. After being captured by Orcs and taken to an underground slave auction, she is thoroughly humiliated by gleeful bidders before being sold off for an exorbitant price to Bozuk, owner of the most renowned brothel in Dark Town. Now forced into a life of prostitution, Iris must attempt to seek out her partner before the pleasures brought by her clients drive her to the brink of insanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With their relationship no longer defined as the mighty Void mage and clueless familiar, she wonders what exactly this means for them.\n\nWhile venturing to a castle, Louise is ambushed by a powerful mage named Sheffield. Battling alone, the young mage nearly faces defeat until Saito makes his appearance. The mystical and unknown nature of Void magic seems to be at work in the battle, and Louise begins to believe in the possibility of another Void user. Moreover, she realizes that Saito's magical rune is fading, and so a new adventure begins as they search for the elf who revived Saito in the past. The relationship between former master and servant faces a new challenge as they work to restore the runes and redefine the bond which holds them together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After young Jack is conned into trading his family's prize cow for a handful of beans, he plants them and discovers they produce a magical vine that rises through the clouds. Climbing the beanstalk, Jack encounters a strange and remarkable world ruled by the magical Princess Margaret. The princess is in love with Prince Tulip despite his unattractive features and harsh personality, but as it turns out, this is the work of Madam Noir, an evil witch who has cast a spell on the princess so she will marry Tulip, her only son. Can Jack help the princess avoid this awful fate? Directed by Japanese animator Gisaburo Sugii, this free adaptation of Jack and the Beanstalk has won a cult following for its fanciful story and wildly colorful design.",

Kotoko is not actually a complete stranger to Irie-kun; unfortunately, a single love letter that she tried to give him in the past has already sealed her fate as far as he is concerned. Throw in some quirky friends and a meddlesome mother, and Kotoko might not even have a snowball's chance in hell of winning the older Irie boy's heart. Yet Kotoko remains optimistic that, because she now lives in his house, her unattainable crush on the genius since the beginning of high school has never been more within reach.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, she encounters an old woman with a scarred face who claims that Maya is the girl she's been looking for-for the old woman has spent years protecting the rights to a 'legendary' play.",

Called the \"black box,\" an international organization called \"Project BB\" was created to research it.\n\nEight boys, including Manabu Yoshimura, attend International Academy, a school located near Project BB headquarters. They are enticed by their teacher Toukichi Hashiba's promise of \"I'll give you class credit,\" and end up getting involved in his experiment. The experiment was to enter the eight empty chambers of meteorite. According to Hashiba's theory, the meteorite should strongly respond to strong human thoughts. He tells them to have a clear image of a great looking gigantic robot; if they do, something should happen...\n\nThen, a big spaceship appears in the sky and an alien calling himself Wercury appears in a 3-D image. He tells them he is from the Star of Prokimasi and that he has come to collect the meteorite of the Choshin people. If they do not hand it over, he will challenge the earth beings to a battle. Manabu and his friends are confused by the unexpected turn of events but the meteorite responds to the thoughts of the group and suddenly starts to transform itself into a gigantic robot. Then, attacked by the invading Prokimasi robot, they are forced to pull their strength together and fight back. But it is extremely difficult to put the wills of the eight together as one and the robot cannot fight in the way it should. The gigantic robot that Hashiba named \"Gakusaver\" and Manabu's eight; can they manage to protect Earth and the meteorite from the Prokimasi invasion?\n\n(Source: King Records)",

Among Parappa’s friends are an anthropomorphized blue cat, lamb, and even a flower.\n\nParappa's adventures range from the ordinary to the bizarre. He crosses paths with mischievous baddies, helps resolve questions of friendship and love, and even goes on trips through time itself. Nothing can change Parappa's positive outlook on life.",
