          "synopsis": "Shi Miao simply cannot stand her lazy, stupid, and unreliable elder brother Shi Fen, who is one year above her at the same high school. Though the two siblings can only depend on each other, Shi Miao's violent tendencies combined with Shi Fen's knack for causing trouble cause them to fight constantly. And so, Shi Miao can only hope that someone might take her brother away—even though, when push comes to shove, Shi Fen always tries to do what he believes is best for his cute younger sister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From the \"firefly inn\" on the banks of the stream, as the grown fireflies danced, they flew to the night sky one after another.\n\nBut only one remains still. It could not fly because the wings were deformed at birth.\n\nFellow fireflies narrowed their wisdom and succeeded in having it climb up the branches of the willow. The view from the top of a tall tree, it was lovely. But, there was danger waiting.\n\nA good older sister and brother came to pick fireflies and tried to catch the disabled firefly. \"Dangerous!\" Having a firefly that can not move to save itself, a brave firefly jumped into the hand of a boy as a self-sacrifice.\n\nBut, they were kind-hearted children. They came to get fireflies for their sister who was unable to walk because of a lame foot. In the room where the light was turned off, fireflies shined brightly. This day, fireflies and the hearts of the children were in unison and spoke with each other.\n\n\"Fireflies, come and see me again\" said the little disabled sister. From the children's window, they saw the hordes of fireflies that came lit up shining like an aurora.",

However, he miraculously regained his life. At the hospital where he was brought in, Kenichi will be in the same room as Jun Hayashi, an older kid who is suffering from heart disease and can only move in a wheelchair.\n\nStudents from class come visit Kenichi with his mother. He didn't have a lively face and found out that the class thinks he fell out of the window as an accident while cleaning it and told his mother that which she believes. \n\nJun has a brighter outlook on life and shows Kenichi his drive to live even though the world is so against him. They two grow closer together and vow to eat great ramen one day. The night before Jun's surgery they accomplish that ramen journey and on the way to the operating room, Jun yells at Kenichi \"if you commit suicide, give me your life. If you don't need it, please give it to me!\"\n\nEveryday Kenichi gets to eat good food, play good games, and do whatever he wants (even to go to school, he can even change schools too) which Jun never even has the opportunity to do because of his heart. Kenichi's will to live is reignited, because there are people out there will even less who would gladly trade their life for his bullied one.",

The outside was so cold and dark, he looked for another house but humans put hiiragi iwashi (holly and sardine head talismans) on house entrances to keep demons away and he could not get in. However, there was only one house without this talisman and without throwing the roasted soybeans. In this house, a girl and sick mother lived together. The girl kept vigil beside her mother’s bed all days and did not have enough time and money to eat meal, not to mention throwing roasted soybeans. Realizing the predicament they were in, Onita found meal from somewhere. Disguising as a man, he offered the meal he got to the girl, saying that he made too much for Setsubun. The meals he offered were sekihan and green bean dish. He then leaves to find a new place to live, leaving only his hat behind.",

However, with the outbreak of the Pacific War (World War II) in 1941, a great number of the \"Blue-eyed Dolls,\" who were considered to be \"dolls of the enemy country,\" were disposed of by being burned or by being stabbed with bamboo spears. \n\nThis is the story of children trying to rescue the doll.\n\n(Source: wgordon.web.wesleyan.edu)",

Currently, about 38 Japanese dolls and 300 blue-eyed dolls are known to still exist. (Source: Japanese Embassy in New York)",
