Abruptly, her mother decides to run away with her new boyfriend from debt collectors, forcing the young girl to fend for herself—as per her mother's \"rely only on yourself\" philosophy—in rural Japan, where her cold grandmother runs a small inn. Driven to adapt to the tranquil lifestyle of the countryside, Ohana experiences and deals with the challenges of working as a maid, as well as meeting and making friends with enthralling people at her new school and the inn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The two fly off and make their way toward the sun.\n\nOn their way, the two of them make a stop at the Planet Gaudy. Upon their arrival, the President steps out to welcome the two. The President invites them to a special party, in which the Emcees show off the planet's most beautiful designs. This does not impress Noel, who states that it doesn't matter what clothes one is wearing, they will still be beautiful and loved. This coaxes the President and the citizens of the planet to take their clothes off, as does Noel. Pup gently reminds Noel of their trip to the sun, and the two take off to find him.\n\nWhen they find him, the sun warns of foul smog emanating from some unknown planet. The two leave the sun to find the source of the smog, but it quickly surrounds them. They escape underwater on another nearby planet. They appreciate the fine scenery underwater, but as they traverse further they notice the fish are ill.",

On June 19, 2011, Mutsumi Akazaki, who drew the manga adaptation of Fractale, stated in a blog post that she found the work \"uninteresting\" and added that she wanted to work on a manga that she enjoyed. The blog post was soon removed. As a result, the anime's director Yutaka Yamamoto requested that the production committee discontinue the manga series, though there was no indication that this was approved. Akazaki later apologised for the remark.",

Each revels in the truly mesmerizing physique of young women and their wild erotic adventures.\n\nShigure Hen and Shigure Hen Okawari\n\nShigure Takashima is the role model of a perfect high schooler. A charming student council president, she excels in sports and prides herself on countless academic achievements. Being born into a wealthy family, what else could she wish for?\n\nWhen Komatsu Kita catches her ferociously masturbating in an empty classroom after school hours, she instantly turns to him for sexual gratification. A relationship soon blooms between the two—one devoted purely to the seemingly insatiable desires of young adults.\n \nKonami Hen\n \nWhen Konami invites her neighbor over for dinner, little does she realize that the person she views as an older brother is actually haunted by sexual fantasies about her. He simply can not get his eyes off her well-endowed chest, and when Konami falls asleep, he decides to take advantage of her.\n \nMiyuki Hen\n \nDespite being an adult, Miyuki continues to bathe with her step-father. Oblivious as she may be, her parent's true intentions are crystal clear. After all, how can anyone resist such a scrumptious young body, displayed in its glorious entirety? The bath soon turns into something few families use it for.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite the visions never appearing clear or concrete, he is able to predict them by sensing the person's \"aura.\" Normally, this skill is a fun trick to play on his classmates, but Yumeji only ever sees himself having the same nightmare every night.\n\nTo his surprise, the nightmare continues in the middle of the day even before Yumeji has fallen asleep. The unexpected event was triggered by a dream demon—an inhabitant of the world of dreams who wants to use Yumeji's body as a vessel to fully enter the real world. However, Yumeji is saved by the timely arrival of Merry Nightmare, another dream demon who can somehow physically manifest without a host and is instead trying to return to her own realm.\n\nAs more dream demons continue to push into reality, it is up to Yumeji and Merry to fight back against the invasion before everyone's nightmares materialize.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
