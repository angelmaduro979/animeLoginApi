          "synopsis": "Dappou Rock is an original song by Neru. The boy in the video is named Datsu.\n\nThis song shows how people can become brainwashed and lose all their time surfing the Internet, ignoring the real world outside of the Internet and blindly following anything they are told. The video is composed of short, colorful, and poorly drawn clips of memes, anime shows, news broadcasts, and clickbait. They are interspersed with advertisements for a cure-all \"Law-Evading Rock,\" depicted as a rainbow-colored disk. Datsu, who is entranced by the stream of clips, blindly follows the advertisements. Near the end of the song, Datsu is tapped on the shoulder by the male group featured on TV. The leader inserts a \"Law-Evading Rock\" disk into Datsu's back. The video then dissolves into a chaotic mix of clips from earlier in the video, with Datsu depicted as having seemingly achieved enlightenment and become a many-armed bodhisattva.\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wiki)",

Events include A-ya playing hide and seek alone, C-ta's murder of A-ya, D-ne's imitation of B-ko, and A-ya and C-ta's childhood memories. After getting a couple words from each participent in the Demise Game, it opens upon the group play Kokkuri-san to summon the Bookmark of Demise.\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wiki)",

Provoked by the illegal trade of \"Ascra,\" an artificial blood source, the population of vampires begins to rapidly increase within the city. Under orders from Lieutenant General Sounosuke Nakajima, the Special Forces Unit 16 gathers vampires within the military to create a new undercover vampire-hunting unit known as Code Zero.\n\nLeading the unit is Colonel Yoshinobu Maeda. Responsible for locating the source of the Ascra trade as well as capturing and killing vampires, he is pressured into producing fruitful results amidst the growing criticism that threatens to decommission the unit. To make matters worse, the vampires within the unit are struggling to grasp their newfound powers and identities now that they are no longer human. With the world at odds against them, the members of Code Zero must find a way to curb the crisis or otherwise fall victim to their own demonic natures.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, he is suddenly struck by lightning and transported to Tokyo in 1964, the first year Japan hosted the Summer Olympics. \n\nMore than accommodated by a family who simply excuses him as a harmless foreigner, Demetrios ends up bringing the knowledge he has gained from the modern era to his own time period whenever he returns after being zapped by lightning. As he repeatedly travels between the two eras, Demetrios learns to impress his fellow villagers and begins to stand up for himself—all just in time to become stronger and organize and participate in his own Olympics back at home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ruby then takes Choco to her room, and the two 'transport' themselves to the Rainbow Village. There, Ruby hears an explanation from Ling Ling, the mayor of Rainbow Village, and transforms herself using her Rainbow Roller into an appropriate clothing to solve problems. Each episode concludes, back home, with another small event.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",
