By the year 2199, humankind has retreated to the depths of underground cities to escape the radiation.\n\nHowever, all hope is not lost, as the distant planet Iscandar offers Earth its final salvation: the Cosmo Reverse System, capable of restoring Earth's irradiated surface. In a desperate bid to retrieve this technology from Iscandar, the Earth Defense Force pours its remaining resources into the Yamato—an innovative, state-of-the-art battleship equipped with an infinite energy Wave Motion Engine.\n\nFrom young talent such as Tactical Officer Susumu Kodai to accomplished veterans like Captain Juuzou Okita, the Yamato's crew consists of many individuals, all varying in their experience on the battlefield. But despite their differences, one goal unifies them all: to complete their perilous 168,000 light-year voyage to Iscandar and save humanity from imminent doom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "China’s Warring States period, a raging dragon that would raze the land for 500 years, saw many kingdoms rise and fall, making way for the next generation of kings and generals to fight for supremacy. Eventually, seven powerful states emerged from the endless cycle of warfare.\n\nIn the kingdom of Qin, Xin, a war-orphaned slave, trains vigorously with fellow slave and best friend, Piao, who shares his proud dream of one day becoming a Great General of the Heavens. However, the two are suddenly forced to part ways when Piao is recruited to work in the royal palace by a retainer of the King.\n\nAfter a fierce coup d'état unfolds, Piao returns to Xin, half dead, with a mission that will lead him to a meeting with China's young King, Ying Zheng, who bears a striking resemblance to Piao. Kingdom follows Xin as he takes his first steps into the great blood-soaked pages of China's history. He must carve his own path to glory on his long quest to become a Great General of the historic Seven Warring States.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hiding his anger, he seeks out his former middle school classmate Jong-Suk (Yang Ik-June). Jong-Suk now works as a ghostwriter for an autobiography, but he dreams of writing his own novel. For the first time in 15 years, they meet. Kyung-Min and Jong-Suk both hide their own current situations and begin to talk about their middle school days.\n\nAt their middle school, they were classified by their wealth and grades. Kyung-Min and Jong-Suk were at the bottom. They were called pigs. They were bullied by a ruling class called dogs. When they were called pigs, they got angry but couldn't do anything against the dogs. Then a king of pigs appears—Chul (Kim Hye-Na). Kyung-Min and Jong-Suk became to rely on Chul-Yi.\n\nNow, leading Jong-Suk to their middle school grounds, Kyung-Min discloses the shocking truth to Jong-Suk of what happened 15 years ago.\n\n(Source: Asian Media Wiki)",

Richard Kimble is now a veterinarian on the lam (lamb?), running from a false conviction for a murder committed by \"a man with overbite.\" Despite the omnipresent danger, he must stoop and intervene whenever he sees a cat (always Michael) suffering; after treating the patient, he plays a trick on the cat and runs away. (He's a fugitive, after all.) Another sketch draws parallels between wandering husbands and wandering house cats, who seem to have similar proclivities. Two more point out what happens when a cat's instincts run up against the requirements of baseball or pro wrestling.\n\n(Source: Orphan Fansubs)",

          "synopsis": "Michael is a fat orange cat who lives with a pair of well-meaning but very stupid humans who fondly imagine he is their pet. But Michael's own daily life is rich in all kinds of little incidents and upheavals-avoiding local bad cat Nyazilla, a monster against whom Michael knows he'll always come out worse, scrounging food from local stores, meeting up with his animal friends, and keeping the humans amused as best he can. And Michael also has a fantasy life even his fellow feline Garfield would envy, with cat corporations, cat nightclubs, and his own imitation of a dancing American megastar also called Michael.\n\n(Source: The Anime Encyclopedia)",

Entrusted to a mystifying woman named Éclair, it is said to contain the power of an ancient phoenix. She wanders the land alone and protects the stone from harm, despite having no memory of why it was left in her care and only the faintest recollection of where she must take it. \n\nAfter encountering the wizard guild Fairy Tail, Éclair receives an offer from Natsu Dragneel and his friends to help her uncover the mysteries surrounding the stone. However, in the midst of the group's journey, Éclair is suddenly attacked and the stone is taken from her. With this, nefarious intentions to revive the blazing phoenix for its unparalleled power come to light, and the wizards of Fairy Tail find themselves in a situation that could spell calamity. They must now work together to prevent the revival of the phoenix and save the world from ruin. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But in order to execute those plans, they must set foot into Shell's domain: the BlueEgg Casino in the center of Mardock City, and find the chip where his memories lie. If they can't find the chip, their case will be dismissed in court, and their \"usefulness\" will be gone – resulting in all of their deaths. Will Balot find the chip in time, while still dodging Boiled and his now mad search for her and Oeufcoque?\n\n(Source: the witch of theatregoing)",

This is a daily occurrence at the Utsumi household, and the fact that his relationship with his step-sister, Miyu, isn't improving is a cause of anguish for Mitsuru. While she may behave like an angel in the presence of their parents, when they are alone, she's a pure devil.\n\nOne day, Mitsuru discovers that Miyu has a complex regarding her bust-size. He unwisely brings it up and she blows up at him. While attempting to restrain the raging Miyu, the two lose their balance and fall. Staring into Miyu's face up close, Mitsuru finds himself drawn by her cute features, the warmth of her body, the peculiar scent of a young girl...\n\n(Source: translated and adapted from official site by Cranston)",

          "synopsis": "Kazuki Okino is an ordinary high schooler living a carefree life. He's always been close to his childhood friend, Otome Sakuragi—a beautiful girl every boy in his school dreams of being with. Because he and Otome often hang out together and get along very well, Kazuki believes that it is inevitable that they begin dating. However, Kazuki's little sister, Rinka, is dissatisfied with this possibility because she is secretly in love with him.\n\nThis innocent relationship takes a dramatic turn when Kazuki receives an untitled DVD showing Otome engaging in sexual activities with elderly men. His despair grows even greater when similar DVDs start arriving on a regular basis. As Kazuki stares in horror at the love of his life being defiled by a group of strangers, he notices Otome's demeanor gradually changing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But their latest task is one that has seen failure from everyone who has attempted it: the subjugation of the impenetrable fortress of Doldrey. \n\nBut with members like Guts—the captain of the Hawks' raiders who can easily fell 100 men with his gigantic sword—such tasks prove to be trivial. However, in the aftermath of the battle, Guts decides to leave the Hawks in order to pursue his own dream and bids farewell to his companions, despite Griffith's attempts to make him stay. This single event causes Griffith to lose his composure, and leads him to make a decision that will alter his and the Hawks' fates forever.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The Band of the Hawk has dwindled in the year since Guts left them on his journey to forge his own destiny. Unaware of their fate, Guts returns to the Hawks—now being led by his former ally Casca—after a rumor about them passes his way. Once the saviors of the kingdom of Midland, the Band of the Hawk are now hunted as they desperately fight for their lives while plotting to free their leader, Griffith, after he was imprisoned for committing treason. But the man they save is far from the Griffith they remember.\n\nGriffith is a shell of his former charismatic self after a year of continuous, horrific torture. No longer able to walk, speak, or even hold a sword, he has nothing but the small, strange trinket, the Crimson Behelit, that will not leave him. The entire Band of the Hawk want to rise to greatness once more, but how much are they willing to sacrifice to return to their past glory? It doesn't seem possible, but when Griffith's heart darkens and a solar eclipse blackens the sky, the Behelit offers a choice that will leave the Band of the Hawk with a blood-soaked fate that will haunt them for the rest of their days.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For childhood friends Natsumi Aizawa, Yuka Hanaki, and Rinko Tamaki, they are confronted with this harsh reality when they are told their group's fourth member, Saki Mizukoshi, is moving away at the end of summer. With this news threatening their friendship, the four girls seek out a magic stone from local folklore—hoping to use its rumored wish-granting powers to keep them together. After following the steps of the supposed legend, they are surprised to discover that the magic is real.\n\nWhile the summer's end looms over the horizon, Natsumi and the others use the stone to ensure they have no lingering regrets until the end. But regardless of what the future might bring, these four friends will never forget the colorful miracles they experience during what could be their final summer together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
