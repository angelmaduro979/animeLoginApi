His abilities catch the attention of Barnabus Ablitt, the principal of the Barbador Academy of Magic, who invites Seiichi to become a teacher at the institution. Coincidentally, Seiichi's classmates from Earth are enrolled there, which will lead to an awkward reunion if he is to meet them.\n\nBehind the scenes, however, an enigmatic cult called The Great Devil Order devises a sinister scheme to resurrect their deity and sacrifice the students of Barbador to hasten the process. As Seiichi's power is second to none, it is up to him to protect not only his friends but also the entire world from the looming darkness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As his class is going on a trip to Paris, widely known as the City of Love, Masamune has the perfect opportunity to get even for his childhood heartbreak.\n\nBefore Masamune can impress Aki, the two meet Muriel Besson, a French high school otaku who aspires to create a romantic comedy manga series. Muriel believes Masamune is the ideal model for the protagonist and asks for his help. The boy reluctantly agrees, dragging Aki along to provide inspiration for the love interest's character. But to do so, the two must show Muriel what Japanese love is like.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, Kanetsugu Gasou is masquerading as Aki's childhood friend, Masamune, to trick and use her. With mix-ups and love rivals galore, Masamune's revenge is proving to be quite the difficult task.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
