Suddenly, a howling noise rang through the city, and when it died down, all music was gone. Ako and Mephisto tried to establish contact with Major Land, but could not get a response.\nFull of worry, Hibiki and the others headed to Major Land, where there was no sign of the former land of overflowing music. The world was desolate without sound, its people devoid of emotion like stone, continuing to play their soundless instruments. The only one left was Ako's friend Suzu, who explained how Aphrodite suddenly changed and took away all music from the land. Ako and Mephisto, unbelieving and determined to find out the truth, headed to the palace where Aphrodite was. Hibiki, Kanade and Ellen decided to chase after Suzu, who had run away after Ako refused to believe her story.\n\nWhile chasing after Suzu, the girls met with 3 men eager to steal the Healing Chest. And as the truth slowly came to light, the Pretty Cure had to face up to the real enemy.",

At the same time he noticed that the priestess was waving a sign, saying help wanted, they noticed him as well and thought that he wanted to join.\n\nAfter talking with them a bit (and surviving their trial) he agreed to protect them on their journey.

While exploring his whereabouts, he notices six familiar girls huddled around a large monitor—his childhood friend Kanae Hokari, the class president Miyakou Ando, his English teacher Natsuki Aoi, his junior Rika Makiba, and his classmates Rinne Byakuya and Nemu Manaka. \n\nAs they attempt to make sense of their current situation, a voice suddenly declares through the monitor, \"The game will now begin.\" The rules of the game are simple yet brutal; assigned as the \"unlocker,\" Keisuke must select one of the girls as his \"keyhole\" and violate her in a specific manner. Only after he does this for five rounds will the group be promised freedom to the outside world.\n\nRefusing to acknowledge the situation, Miyakou vehemently denies her participation. Suddenly, the entire room goes dark. When the lights come back on, Miyakou is strapped to an electric chair. \"Withdrawal from the game will result in death,\" announces the mysterious voice as the chair electrocutes her to death. \n\nLeft with no other option, the terrified captives concede, and thus begins the sadistic game that will awaken their carnal desires through pain—and pleasure.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Tezuka × Atobe ÷ Koharu\nFudomine Middle School's tennis captain, Kippei Tachibana, asks rival school captains Kunimitsu Tezuka, Keigo Atobe, and Kuranosuke Shiraishi to assist him with his team's practice. Shiraishi's teammate, Koharu Konjiki, decides to tag along in hopes of being able to see his crush. Instead, Konjiki ends up becoming infatuated with both Tezuka and Atobe and struggles to pick between the two.\n\nFuji Kyoudai no Houkago (Fuji Brothers After School)\nSeishun's Shuusuke Fuji asks his younger brother Yuuta to go shopping with him to pick out a present for their older sister's birthday. As they proceed with their plans, Yuuta's teammates from the St. Rudolph Academy tennis team catch a glimpse of the two brothers and initially think nothing of it. However, St. Rudolph's manager, Hajime Mizuki, misinterprets the situation and believes Shuusuke is trying to get Yuuta to transfer back to Seishun. In an effort to stop his plans, Hajime forces the team to secretly follow the brothers around.\n\nInitial A\nRikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's Akaya Kirihara always seems to get himself into sticky situations. Out on a shopping trip with Bunta Marui and Jackal Kuwahara, Kirihara bumps into Seishun's Takashi Kawamura, causing a stuffed toy Kawamura was carrying to go flying into a nearby dog's mouth. The two begin to chase the dog in order to get the toy back. Kawamura later recounts the story to Yamabuki Middle School's Jin Akutsu, who seems less than enthused about the ordeal.\n\nKai☆Para\nSeishun's Eiji Kikumaru shows up to morning tennis practice tired after staying up late at night to play Kai☆Para, a new online game. Vice-captain Shuichirou Oishi seems perplexed by the concept of an online game, which shocks his teammates. Eiji convinces his doubles partner to log onto the game later that night but fails to tell him the full name of the game, causing Oishi to play a different game instead that uses the same moniker.\n\nNagisa no Motemote Watching (Beachside's Popular Watching)\nRokkaku Middle School's tennis captain, Kentarou Aoi, is jealous of his teammate Kojirou Saeki and Yamabuki's Kiyosumi Sengoku, both of whom can effortlessly attract women. Overhearing his troubles, Shitenhouji's Konjiki decides to tell him the secrets to winning over a woman's heart.\n\nOmae no Kimochi ga Wakaranai (I Don't Understand Your Feelings!)\nAfter coming to afternoon practice late, Hyoutei Academy's Choutarou Ootori accidentally overhears the team's third years discussing who will become the captain once they graduate. Ootori's doubles partner, Ryou Shishido, states that between him and Wakashi Hiyoshi, he would choose Hiyoshi to lead Hyoutei. This upsets Ootori greatly and the two end up fighting during practice. In an effort to cool down, Shishido sets out to train on his own but runs into Seishun's Kaoru Kaidou, who offers his two cents on his situation.\n\nDocchi no Megane Show (Whose Glasses Are These?)\nAfter knocking over a display stand, Higa Middle School's Yuujirou Kai bumps into Hyoutei's Hiyoshi, knocking his contact right out of his eye. As Hiyoshi searches for his missing contact, his teammate Yuushi Oshitari and Seishun's Sadaharu Inui begin to argue over what type of glasses would best suit him.\n\nUnabara-matsu! (The Ocean Festival)\nSeishun's Ryouma Echizen and Takeshi Momoshiro are invited by Rikkai's Genichirou Sanada to their school's Ocean Festival. The tennis team is putting on a \"Cinderella\" play for the festival with Kirihara playing the main role, though the second-year ace is reluctant to be wearing a frilly pink dress for the part.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
