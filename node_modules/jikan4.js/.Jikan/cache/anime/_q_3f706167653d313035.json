          "synopsis": "Patarillo! is set in a society much like ours in most ways, with one decided twist. The manga on which it is based is one of the much-read works produced for adolescent Japanese girls that features a healthy proportion of gay men and beautiful teenagers aka bishounen (beautiful boys). Most of the action takes place in Marinera, the land of eternal spring, located somewhere in the South Seas. The country is a major producer of diamonds; they provide much of the basis of conflict in the anime series. They come from one of the most prolific mines in the world, owned by the king of Marinera, the vertically challenged but horizontally endowed boy-king Patarillo himself. The International Diamond Syndicate - a huge semi- criminal organization/ secret society dedicated to taking over the world's entire diamond supply- wants that mine and will stop at nothing to get it. In the early episodes they send off a number of bishounen assassins to do in Patarillo, which necessitates his having a bodyguard, the English MI6 agent, Major Jack ('Bishounen-Killer') Bancoran. Bancoran's nickname doesn't mean he shoots bishounen in cold blood. The soubriquet comes from the fact that no male under the age of 17 can resist his sexual fascination. This, to Bancoran's eternal disgust, includes Patarillo himself. The action switches often from Marinera to MI6 headquarters in London (London seems to be an easy two hour's flight from the South Seas) or Bancoran's palatial condo in the suburbs of same. (MI6, be it noted, looks a lot like Fritz Lang's Metropolis, while Jack's 'apartment' bears a passing resemblance to Randolph Hearst's spread.) The action also goes into the past and future and out into space. Patarillo evidently gets around.\n\n(Source: aestheticism.com)",

His father, Halvar, is the chief of the Vikings, and would have liked a son a little more courageous. So, he and his team take Wicke along on their journeys to give him the experience he'll need to be a real Viking. Yet, somehow Halvar and his men end up trapped or hopelessly stuck somewhere in most cases, and it`s up to Wickie alone to help them out with his flashes of wit.\n\n(Source: IMDb)",

Apparently, they've got more important things to do than becoming teenage super-heroes. Besides, how are you supposed to study for your college entrance exams while getting beaten-up in battle?\n\nFortunately for Dr. Kishida, things aren't too well for the invaders, either. According to their reports, the Earth was the perfect target: lush, peaceful, and relatively defenseless. Theoretically, the planet should've surrendered long ago. Now, the war is at a standstill, the dreaded Accounting Department is warning about the serious cost overruns, and the head of the home office has arrived from Galactic Headquarters to personally oversee operations. Has Headquarters decided to unleash, The Audit—or do they have something even more evil in mind?\n\nThe fate of the world rests upon two people: Aya Kishida, one of the doctor's granddaughters, who may have to give up prep school to pilot the mighty (and lovely) ARIEL; and a mysterious alien named Saber Starblast, who may have the power to defeat the invaders once and for all...\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

          "synopsis": "The beautiful Alamos Town is home to a pair of century-old structures known as the Space-Time Towers, built by the architect Godey to play orchestral music in the area. The towers are also home to the Alamos Town Contest Hall, which is the next destination for Hikari, Satoshi, and Takeshi in their journey through the Sinnoh region. A woman named Alice and her partner Chimchar are happy to guide Satoshi and his friends through the town and its hallmarks.\n\nBut the tour is suddenly interrupted when Alice's friend Tonio notices a wave of dimensional disturbances throughout the town—all of which is blamed on an ominous Pokémon named Darkrai. The space-time disturbances continue to intensify as two legendary Pokémon, the Temporal Pokémon Dialga and the Spatial Pokémon Palkia, appear to duel each other, isolating the town and everyone present in it from the world into another dimension!\n\nAs he learns that this event was foreseen long ago, Tonio finds that his great-grandfather left behind a way to stop the dueling Pokémon. Will Satoshi and his friends be able to use this last resort to save Alamos Town from vaporizing between the dimensions?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Oh, gimme a break! Who do these guys think they are? The Ninku?\n\nUnfortunately for the real Aito, Choji, Rihoko, and Fuusuke, they do. But little did these imposters know when they stumbled on this sleepy little desert town, that there’d be a price to pay for being treated like the real Ninku, namely, having to fight the deadly Heaven &amp; Earth brothers!\n\nFortunately for our phony friends, the real Aito, Choji, and Fuusuke step in, there’s nothing but trouble for the bad guys. Can the Ninku art of magic fighting beat the Heaven &amp; Earth brothers deadly fighting style?\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Unfortunately, this pretty reporter with a spotless reputation has a very dark secret. She's addicted to masturbation, and she can't stop for even a second!\n\nWhen she is caught using a vibrator on the air by the cue-card holder, she's in real trouble. He's not above a little blackmail, so she's completely under his power. Not only does he show her what the real thing is like, but he also installs a remote-control vibrator into her panties for fun on the air!\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Her new husband has three beautiful, young daughters who are now going to be Yuu's stepsisters. Due to the nature of his work, Yuu's now-stepfather is often away from home, leaving the house to his children to use as they please. \n\nAs he settles in his new room, Yuu notices a mysterious package addressed to him. Inside, he finds a glass bottle labeled \"Vial of Inanna,\" which apparently contains a deadly curse he is now afflicted with. The only way to lift the curse is to collect a significant amount of female bodily fluids while leaving their owners unaware of its existence. As horrible and difficult to fulfill as that may sound, Yuu soon realizes that the presence of three more-than-willing-to-cooperate girls in an empty house might be helpful.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
