But upon arriving, he is dumbfounded to discover that the vampire quickly turns to ash by something as trivial as a clap of his hands! Moreover, the child he was sent to save had merely wandered in to play the vampire lord's video games while he slept!\n\nIn a disastrous turn of events, Draluc's castle is destroyed, and the fragile vampire decides to move in with the hunter who has only just defeated him. Ronald, Draluc, and the vampire's pet armadillo John form quite the eccentric team as they are forced to work together while fending off Ronald's violent editor, the lesser vampires plaguing the city, and even their fellow vampire hunters.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Long ago, the king of Orvelia, Kyle, defeated the demon king Angmund and brought peace to the world. However, one hundred years later, demons have been sighted in the forests, threatening humanity once more. A scouting expedition is sent to verify the claim but only one member returns. Meanwhile, Riheet, the leader of a dark elf mercenary group, plots to take over Orvelia to exact revenge against the humans who forsook their race a century ago.\n\nThe knight apprentice Kasel, accompanied by the priestess Frey, sets out to rescue Clause, an old friend who went missing in the tragic mission. However, along the way,  Kasel discovers that he is the son of the revered King Kyle and the only one who can wield the Holy Sword Aea—the same sword that slew the demon king. To fulfill this destiny, the young knight must embark on a perilous quest, unseal the sword, and end the fear instilled by demons. As Kasel's journey to bring hope to humanity and Riheet's vow for vengeance intertwine, what fate could possibly await them?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Hyoutei Academy's tennis team captain, Keigo Atobe, nominates the best team in the region to participate: Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School. On behalf of the Rikkai tennis team, Seiichi Yukimura accepts the challenge to showcase the prowess of its members.\n\nAmidst tense preparations, the third-years of Hyoutei supervise next year's captain, Wakashi Hiyoshi. At the same time, the third-year members of Rikkai begin to worry whether Akaya Kirihara, the team's lone second-year member, can lead the club to glory once again. Determined to overthrow their respective captains' legacies during the match, both Hiyoshi and Kirihara continue rigorous training to prove they have what it takes to succeed them.\n\nThe future of Hyoutei and Rikkai rests on the shoulders of these second-year aces, who harbor high expectations and ambitious goals. Emboldened by their endeavors, the third-years of each respective team impart their feelings to the second-years that will be carrying the torch for their schools once they graduate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, while pleasuring himself as usual, his erotic magazine begins to glow and Naoki suddenly finds himself in a fantastic world. He appears among three female adventurers who later present themselves as the swordswoman Filia Shiora, the priestess Tiane Rutheim, and the elf Llusse. They explain to Naoki that the world is in danger of destruction due to the resurrection of the Demon King, and the only way to save it is for him to use his special power—feeding his semen to the three girls so as to increase their strength exponentially. Of course, the young hero agrees to join the party, and his erotic quest begins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "For her sake, he would sacrifice anything...\n\nWhile volunteering in Nepal, a Korean medical student named Sangmin Han encounters the beautiful yet tragic Sita. Previously, she was a Kumari—a prepubescent girl worshipped as the vessel of a goddess. But she has since been forsaken as a Kumari, and cast out from society. Falling in love, they marry and move to Korea, but their blissful love is short-lived; Sita dies only a year later.\n\nLosing the woman dearest to him, Sangmin desperately begs the gods to bring Sita back. His prayers are answered but in exchange for a sacrifice, and he awakens in the streets of Nepal. However, something is amiss—his body has suddenly aged, and standing in front of him is a young Sita, with no memory of him.\n\nThrough two lovers bound together by a destiny running deeper than it first appears, For the Sake of Sita is the story of Sita growing up as a Kumari, and Sangmin's tribulations in trying to avert her terrible fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Sixth-grade student Kanna Hayama's love of running becomes a source of grief when she loses her mother Yayoi, whom she shared this passion with. However, her disposition changes after she accidentally discovers an astonishing truth about Yayoi.\n\nOne day, Kanna unexpectedly encounters a divine messenger in the form of her favorite rabbit Shiro and a demon boy named Yasha. They reveal to the girl that her mother was an \"Idaten\"—a descendant of the gods endowed with incredible speed and entrusted to bring offerings from all over Japan to the annual Kamiari Festival in Izumo. As Yayoi's daughter and the new possessor of the Idaten amulet, Kanna is expected to take over this responsibility; otherwise, there will be dire consequences for the country's fate in the year to come.\n\nEnticed by the prospect of seeing her mother once more at the deities' event, Kanna accepts the challenge and enlists Shiro and Yasha to help her on her quest. Unbeknownst to her, there is more than meets the eye to this marathon-like journey that will test not only her physical condition but also her heart's resolve.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Kamiarizuki no Kodomo is a Cretica Universal project, financed through three crowdfunding campaigns on Sony’s First Flight website from March 27, 2019 to June 1, 2020. While initially planned to be released in 2020, the film was delayed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anime Expo Lite 2021 hosted a preview of the movie on July 3, 2021. Netflix streamed the film on February 8, 2022 after acquiring its distribution license. Inspired by the Japanese mythology behind Izumo's Kamiari Festival, Kamiarizuki no Kodomo is an original story by Cretica Universal's founder Toshinari Shinohe, who aimed to express and convey Japan's rich culture to the world. A sticker rally was held in Shimane from October 8, 2021 to February 28, 2022, allowing visitors to see locations associated with the movie and obtain special stickers at three designated points. Kodansha issued three books based on the movie prior to its release on August 12, 2021, September 15, 2021, and September 30, 2021, respectively. The first was co-authored by the original creator himself; the second was a novelized version of the film; and the third was a picture book.",

          "synopsis": "Despite his noble title, Noir Stalgia is at the bottom of the social hierarchy. Because of this, his fellow nobles oppress him and treat him like garbage. However, he possesses a rare yet powerful ability to communicate with the Great Sage, an oracle who grants Noir the answer to absolutely anything.\n\nAfter failing to secure a job as a librarian, Noir decides to join the Hero Academy. He knows he must become stronger to enter the institution. The Great Sage advises him to explore a hidden dungeon deep within the mountains. There, Noir meets Olivia Servant, a beautiful yet enchained maiden trapped within the labyrinth. Olivia bestows upon Noir a set of ridiculously powerful skills that grants him virtually total control over reality. Naturally, there is a catch—every time Noir attempts to use his powers, his life points decrease, putting his life at risk. To replenish his energy, he must give in to worldly pleasures such as kissing his childhood friend!\n\nWith his newfound powers, Noir begins his journey as a student in the Hero Academy, meeting new acquaintances and helping them through the dire situations ahead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But their joyous days come to an end when a forest fire separates them and Towa is thrown through a portal to modern-day Japan. There, she is found by Souta Higurashi, who raises her as his daughter after Towa finds herself unable to return to her time.\n\nTen years later, 14-year-old Towa is a relatively well-adjusted student, despite the fact that she often gets into fights. However, unexpected trouble arrives on her doorstep in the form of three visitors from Feudal Japan; Moroha, a bounty hunter; Setsuna, a demon slayer and Towa's long-lost twin sister; and Mistress Three-Eyes, a demon seeking a mystical object. Working together, the girls defeat their foe, but in the process, Towa discovers to her horror that Setsuna has no memory of her at all. Hanyou no Yashahime: Sengoku Otogizoushi follows the three girls as they endeavor to remedy Setsuna's memory loss, as well as discover the truth about their linked destinies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Zuo Yunqi is just an ordinary young master, but to save his father, he disguises himself as an outsider to join the government.\n\nUnfortunately, his disguise is broken by a man hired specifically to identify who's a real outsider and who isn't. In their battle of wits, the two of them end up in many comedic situations and eventually become allies. As the two of them stop a shocking conspiracy, they discover that some of the outsiders have formed their own alliance to revolt against those in power and create a new society of peace and equality. Zuo Yunqi and his friends are forced to join in and become a part of this battle...\n\n(Source: Baidu)",
