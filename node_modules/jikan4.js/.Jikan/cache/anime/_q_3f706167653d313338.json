Flora is adored by her students, the principal of the school, and all the town’s people, and enjoys a peaceful life in the town.\n\nBy chance, she meets a strange youth named Locke.

The Union (aware of the attacks) thought this was very strange, and decided to investigate Lordleon with Locke's help.\n\n(Source: Official Site)",

While looking over résumés for a head patissier, one name sticks out in particular: Yuusuke Ono, the young man who confessed his feelings to Keiichirou in high school—and whom Keiichirou harshly shot down. Now, Yuusuke is known both as a genius patissier for his skills in the kitchen, and for possessing a demonic charm that attracts even straight men into his bedroom.\n\nDespite their shared past, Keiichirou hires Yuusuke and starts working on making the bakery a success. Before long, the pair is joined by former boxer Eiji Kanda, who is searching for a new career after an injury forced him to retire early. Everything is looking up for the newly-opened bakery named Antique—but the ghosts of the employees' pasts threaten to upset their simple lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But a small green Pokémon gets gotten dragged in as well—and though it somehow escapes, Dialga uses this opportunity to escape as well after preventing Giratina from chasing after it.\n\nAfter accidentally ruining Satoshi and his friends' picnic, the green Pokémon is taken to the Pokémon Center where it is treated for injuries and introduced as Shaymin, the mythical Gratitude Pokémon. Using telepathy, Shaymin demands that Satoshi, Hikari, and Takeshi take it somewhere. But before they can find out where to go, the group find themselves being pursued by both Giratina and a strange man named Zero—both in search of little Shaymin! Will Satoshi and his friends be able to find Shaymin's desired place while keeping themselves out of danger?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "They're cute, adorable and three of the most powerful Espers the world has ever seen: Kaoru, the brash psychokinetic who can move objects with her mind; Shiho, the sarcastic and dark natured psychometric able to pick thoughts from people's minds and read the pasts of inanimate objects like a book; and Aoi, the most collected and rational of the three, who has the ability to teleport herself and the others at will. So what to do with these potential psychic monsters in the making? Enter B.A.B.E.L., the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory, where hopefully \"The Children\" and others like them can become part of the answer to an increasing wave of psychic evolution. It's a win-win solution... Unless you're Koichi Minamoto, the overworked young man stuck with the unenviable task of field commanding a team of three pre-teen girls! \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",
