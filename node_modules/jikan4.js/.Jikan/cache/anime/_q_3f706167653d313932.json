He requests that Watanuki investigates his grandson's dreams. While inside the dream world, he discovers how their past adventures played out from Doumeki's perspective of view, leading Watanuki to discover truths from 10 years ago and secrets about the ties that bind their friendship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Branded a heretic, he must now face the consequences of his actions.\n\nThe Package depicts a group of Spartans, including the Master Chief, who are deployed to infiltrate a Covenant flagship and retrieve a “package” in a secret operation.\n\nOrigins shows Master Chief and Cortana stranded following the events of Halo 3, with Cortana summarizing the fall of the Forerunners, the defeat of the Flood, and the rise of humanity as well as the events of the Human-Covenant War.\n\nHomecoming centers on the Spartan Daisy, who reminisces on her past, and the SPARTAN-II project while evacuating UNSC soldiers pinned down by Covenant forces.\n\nPrototype is viewed from the perspective of Marine Sergeant Ghost, who is determined to fight for all he is worth in order to make up for past grievances.\n\nOdd One Out is a non-canon parody of Halo featuring Spartan 1337, who suffers from extremely bad luck.",

While held captive by terrorists, he develops the Iron Man Suit  and escapes. From that day on, he vows not to waste his second chance at life and to change the world for the better. For that purpose, he comes to Japan.\n\nIn Lab 23 in Japan, great strides have been taken to develop, and build, a unique power station which does not run on fossil fuels, the Arc Station. Stark intends to join this project, and, for that, he is ready to announce his retirement as Iron Man. At the same time, he will also announce the Mass-produced Iron Men, to which he will pass on his duties. However, during the ceremonies, Stark is suddenly attacked by combat mecha belonging to an organization known as Zodiac.",

However, Ganta's life is quickly turned upside down when his whole class gets massacred by a mysterious man in red. Framed for the incident and sentenced to death, Ganta is sent to the very jail he was supposed to visit. \n\nBut Ganta's nightmare is only just beginning. \n\nThe young protagonist is thrown into a world of sadistic inmates and enigmatic powers, to live in constant fear of the lethal collar placed around his neck that is slowed only by winning in the prison's deathly games. Ganta must bet his life to survive in a ruthless place where it isn't always easy to tell friend from foe, all while trying to find the mysterious \"Red Man\" and clear his name, in Deadman Wonderland.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While Marina has accepted their new stepfather, Airi hates him for breaking their family. Furthermore, she soon finds out he is a sexual deviant, sniffing his underaged stepdaughters' underwear and secretly desiring to take their virginity. Their mother is often absent from home, allowing Kouzou to pursue his carnal pleasures to his heart's content.\n\nUnable to resist the beauty of adolescent girls' bodies, Akizuki prepares a powerful aphrodisiac and uses it on Airi. Intoxicated with the drug, she can no longer control herself and gives in to her stepfather's perverted demands. She soon discovers the merits of this new relationship and plunges headlong into a whirlpool of sexual degeneracy.\n\nSatisfied with the drug's irresistible effect, Kouzou proceeds to utilize it further, coercing various girls to quench his thirst in the most embarrassing ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In 1864 Japan, a young woman named Chizuru Yukimura is searching for her missing father, Koudou, a doctor by trade whose work often takes him far from home. But with no word from him in months, Chizuru disguises herself as a man and heads to Kyoto in search of him. Attracting the attention of ronin, she tries to hide and ends up witnessing a horrifying sight: the ronin being brutally murdered by crazed white-haired men. In a startling turn of events, members of the Shinsengumi arrive to dispatch the creatures. But Chizuru's safety doesn't last long, as this group of men tie her up and take her back to their headquarters, unsure of whether to let her live or silence her permanently.\n\nHowever, once she reveals the name of her father, the Shinsengumi decide to keep her safe, as they too have been searching for him. But Koudou is more connected to the Shinsengumi than they let on, and soon Chizuru finds herself embroiled in a conflict between the Shinsengumi and their enemies, as well as political tension in Kyoto.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
