Too powerful to be subdued by ordinary folks, the creatures are hunted by the Insect Magistrates—a group of warriors who specialize in various secret arts and combat styles. To bolster their strength, they summon Genjuurou Tsukishima, the master swordsman from the Tsugaru Province.\n\nDue to an unfortunate incident, however, Genjuurou is incapable of answering the call and sends his son, Jinbee, to serve in his stead. Determined to atone for the incident caused by his own cowardice, Jinbee agrees to travel to Edo and join the Insect Magistrates. Armed with his fiery spirit and unwavering resolve, Jinbee vows to become a stronger samurai and rid Edo of the insect threat once and for all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though at first the siblings are confused as to why the girl has arrived, they soon realize that she is to be their new \"sacrificial bride,\" not to mention their other, more carnal intentions for her. After meeting the brothers, Yui quickly begins to question why her father would have sent her here and why she feels a strange, new pain in her chest. With each brother more sadistic than the last, Yui's life as a captive takes a harrowing turn in her new home. As her days turn into endless nights, and each brother vows to make her his own, Yui falls deeper and deeper into madness and ecstasy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While the first episode is an adaption of chapter 8, the second episode is original content.\n\nPreparation for the cultural festival have begun. As president and vice president of the student council, as well as a couple, Reiko and Shintaro are given the jobs of keeping tabs on the preparation together. While browsing through campus, they find a fellow student who request they sample the drink he was making for the festival. Suddenly, not knowing why, Reiko starts feeling aroused and decides to take Shintaro into a classroom set up as a dark maze. Shortly while inside the two are separated and when reunited, Reiko finds herself unable to control her urges and allows Shintaro to help release her sexual desires but only to find out it wasn't him who found her, Shintaro had already left the room.\n\nShintaro has noticed that Reiko has been acting strange after the incident he knows nothing about and decides to consult Misaki for help, another member of the student council. She suspects Reiko is tired from the preparation work for the cultural festival and the two decide they all take a trip to an amusement park. On the day of the trip, Shintaro and Reiko meet up but Misaki was no where to be found. Reiko suddenly receives an email on her phone. A shocking expression she lets out as she looks upon the image she receive, an image of what has happened to Misaki.",

          "synopsis": "Hotaru Ichijou's lifestyle completely changes when she leaves Tokyo and moves with her family to the isolated Asahigaoka village. Her new school has only five students including herself, all sharing a single classroom regardless of grade level. There are no convenience stores in the area, and it can take up to two hours for a bus to arrive.\n\nNevertheless, Hotaru finds herself captivated by the countryside's charm thanks to her four unique schoolmates with whom she quickly forms a genuine bond. The most colorful of them is Renge Miyauchi, a first-grader who is often perceptive despite her age. However, no less intriguing are the three Koshigaya siblings: the quiet oldest brother Suguru, the petite older sister Komari, and the prankish youngest sister Natsumi.\n\nHaving someone from the city join their cheerful little group enlivens the ordinary days in Asahigaoka. Not only does Hotaru bring firsthand knowledge from the alluring outside world, but her fresh outlook on life welcomes a blossom of change to their usual routine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
