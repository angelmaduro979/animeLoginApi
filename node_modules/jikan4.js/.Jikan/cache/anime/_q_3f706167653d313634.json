Their relationship perseveres through thick and thin, and when Marie suddenly develops a hearing impairment during her middle school days, Komaki is there to support her—often by selecting books for her enjoyment.\n\nBut one fateful morning, Komaki finds himself arrested by the Media Betterment Committee, which charges him with invading the privacy of a minor due to the supposedly insensitive content of one of his recommended novels. Knowing that what awaits their friend at the \"inquiry\" is more akin to torture, the members of the LTF look for ways to save Komaki before it is too late.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the help of Danma Kuusou, his companion Pyrus Dragonoid, and other Battle Brawlers, the Infinity and Silent Cores were combined and the realm was recreated.\n\nHowever, New Vestroia will not be given any respite as humanoid alien invaders, the Vestals, arrive and conquer the Bakugan world in one fell swoop. Armed with a fearsome machine capable of restricting Bakugan into their ball forms, they aim to enslave the race as a form of entertainment.\n\nNow, the only force standing in their way is the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance—a group of humans, Bakugan, and Vestals who oppose the idea of annihilating a sentient race. Led by Danma, they must venture into enemy-occupied New Vestroia and repel the invaders, to assure the survival of the entire world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Lawrence and his sharp-witted partner continue to make some small profits along the way, while slowly uncovering more information about Holo's hometown. However, the road to Yoitsu is a bumpy one filled with many troubles—Lawrence runs into a charming young fellow merchant who has his eyes set on the female wolf companion, and he begins to doubt if Holo will remain by his side; he and the goddess will also have to consider precarious and risky business deals as Lawrence strives to achieve his dream of becoming a shopowner. All the while, with his determination tested at every turn during his journey, Lawrence must question his relationship with Holo, take on business ventures, and ask himself whether it is time for him and Holo to go their separate ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Oshaka School in Kamakuland is a prestige school of the world where only those who are pure and clearheaded descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan may be admitted. As for the familiar villain trio, they are in firm belief that they are genuine descendants of Priest Sanzo's clan although actually they are of uncertain lineage. They study hard to enter the school in spite of their repeated failure. One day three intelligent children are called in by the principal and asked by Shakyamuni dwelling in his body to find missing puzzle copperplates scattered all over the world and complete the puzzle board to heighten honor of Oshaka School. The conversation, however, is overheard by the villain trio and they decide to forestall those selected youngsters. Then they happen to meet with a brilliant boy named koochan who appears handy and so they take him with them and attempt to take away puzzle copperplates from a goblin. At the same time they try to win the goblin over to their side and attack our heroes together. Being aware of the evil scheme, Koochan transforms himself into Itadakiman and fights bravely to drive the wicked trio away.\n\n(Source: Official site)",

Out of all the warring generals, Nobunaga Oda—the \"Demon King of Owari\"—has established himself as the strongest ruler. Friend or foe, he is determined to crush anyone who stands in his way of creating a tyrannical central government. \n\nThe only two who dare rebel against Oda are the \"One-eyed Dragon of Oshu\" Masamune Date, and the distinguished but hot-blooded warrior of the Takeda clan, Yukimura Sanada. Though they share the goal of preventing Oda from unifying the domains, Masamune and Yukimura cannot see eye-to-eye. Equally skilled in combat, mutual admiration for one another causes these two feuding warriors to forge a fierce rivalry, thwarting any attempts to form a united front against the Demon King of Owari. \n\nWith Oda's forces closing in on their respective territories, Masamune and Yukimura reluctantly learn to put aside their differences and fight together against the threatening usurpator.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
