Magically, it becomes its own person.\n\nThe music video represents how the Vocaloid franchise has given voice to many people who are too scared or too muddled in their own talents to sing on behalf of the music they created. And while it is a computer software, it's thanks to those peoples' creations that the Vocaloids themselves have gone on to have their own self-standing personas.",

Here, he entices an innocent girl who has trouble sleeping by taking away her bad dreams. He also \"seals the spell\" with a pinky promise and then later a kiss. In the end, \"when the full moon rises\" he steals her soul and takes her empty body to his \"monochrome world.\"\n\n(Source: Vocaloid Wikia)",

          "synopsis": "Many of us know what it is like to transition to a new school with few to no friends in a new environment, going through the arduous process of getting to know people again. Bocchi Hitori knows this struggle all too well, having just graduated from elementary school and thrown into middle school. Unfortunately, she suffers from extreme social anxiety: she faints when overwhelmed, vomits when nervous, and draws up ridiculously convoluted plans to avoid social contact. It does not help that her only friend from elementary school, Kai Yawara, will not be attending the same middle school as Bocchi. However, wanting to help her, Kai severs ties with Bocchi and promises to reconcile with her when she befriends all of her classmates in her new middle school class.\n\nEven though Bocchi has no faith in herself, she is determined to be friends with Kai again. Summoning all of her courage, Bocchi takes on the daunting challenge of making friends with her entire class, starting with the delinquent-looking girl sitting in front of her...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Freshman Minnie has joined the CMFU Fencing Club because of her fascination with \"Three Musketeers\". The swordsman contest is coming soon, and the president Chu Zhuoran intends to conduct an internal trial in the fencing club to select contestants for the swordsman contest. Minnie was excluded because of her zero foundation, but she didn't get discouraged and approached the president Chu Zhuoran to ask for fair participation in the selection. In desperation, Chu Zhuoran decided to give Minnie a week to personally train her. The Fencing Club of the Yunzong Academy in the same city also came here, not only to find out the strength of the newly recruited female swordsmen of CMFU, but Lian Kai, the president of the Fencing Club of the Yunzong Academy, had a holiday with A Qiao, a member of the CMFU Fencing Club. This series shows how the CMFU Academy Fencing Club prepares for the swordsman competition and Minnie's growth as a zero-base fencer, conveys the charm of campus sports, encourages more audiences to learn about fencing and love the sport of fencing.\n\n(Source: Tencent video)",

Siblings Kanini and Kanino live peacefully with their father while their mother is above the surface to give birth. However, during a fierce storm, their father is lost downstream, so the siblings set out to find him on their own. But the waters are not free of danger, and a flesh-hungry piranha could be hiding behind any stone.\n\nSamurai Egg (Life Ain't Gonna Lose)\nIn a carefully monitored hospital room, one boy writhes in pain at the mere taste of eggs. His name is Shun, and he has had a severe egg allergy his whole life. As a child, Shun is careless and his condition is frustrating—as it is to his mother, who is constantly battling his egg intolerance and near death experiences. But, through perseverance, Shun learns to live despite the amount of eggs in the world around him.\n\nToumei Ningen (Invisible)\nAn invisible man starts his monotonous day as usual—by putting on clothes and the weight of a fire extinguisher on his shoulders to keep his airy body grounded. Although he interacts with the tangible world, no one actually seems to acknowledge his presence. That is, until he meets a kind-hearted blind individual in a heavy storm, one that may show him the purpose of his isolated life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
