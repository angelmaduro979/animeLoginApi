She is greeted by Yoru, an entity that guides her through the realm of the darkest, most beautiful time of day. As Chiyo learns to cope with the loss in her heart, the starless world around her begins to light up.\n\n26-ji no Sagashimono (The 26 O'Clock Search)\nSince childhood, best friends Hina and Tsumugi have used an exchange diary as a token of their friendship. Angered that Hina wants to open up the diary to include a new girl she has befriended, the jealous Tsumugi throws it away. Upon falling asleep, she wakes up in front of a labyrinth within the Night World. Initially refusing to take Yoru's help, Tsumugi searches for an answer to her predicament, but she is confronted by her feelings of loneliness instead. \n\n4-ji no Tegami (The 4 O'Clock Letter)\nAnother morning is approaching, and the thought fills Akatsuki with dread. Dejected from her inability to build a career, she begins to throw away her art pieces, stumbling upon an old sketchbook in the process. Within the book is a letter from a former friend who, a long time ago, had given her hope. As she continues going through her belongings, Akatsuki starts to remember the friend's identity—and she might even discover her fading passion for painting.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "High school student Wakana Gojou spends his days perfecting the art of making hina dolls, hoping to eventually reach his grandfather's level of expertise. While his fellow teenagers busy themselves with pop culture, Gojou finds bliss in sewing clothes for his dolls. Nonetheless, he goes to great lengths to keep his unique hobby a secret, as he believes that he would be ridiculed were it revealed. \n\nEnter Marin Kitagawa, an extraordinarily pretty girl whose confidence and poise are in stark contrast to Gojou's meekness. It would defy common sense for the friendless Gojou to mix with the likes of Kitagawa, who is always surrounded by her peers. However, the unimaginable happens when Kitagawa discovers Gojou's prowess with a sewing machine and brightly confesses to him about her own hobby: cosplay. Because her sewing skills are pitiable, she decides to enlist his help.\n\nAs Gojou and Kitagawa work together on one cosplay outfit after another, they cannot help but grow close—even though their lives are worlds apart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In a world where monster invasions are rampant and frequent, being an adventurer in a party is considered one of the most desirable jobs for the honor and fame it provides. Wanting to make a name for himself, a young human warrior named Alvin intends to start his career by completing a low-level request for the guild.\n\nWhile en route, Alvin is confronted by a magical bear and immediately finds himself in a pinch. As luck would have it, a dark elf healer named Karla approaches and asks if Alvin requires assistance—being seemingly oblivious to the situation before her eyes. After a discussion needlessly complicated by Karla's absurdly eccentric personality, Alvin somehow convinces her to help him. Unfortunately, instead of healing him, she accidentally casts a curse: if Alvin strays too far from her, he shall die.\n\nDespite being forced to accompany Karla until the curse is broken, Alvin remains steadfast in his ambition to become a full-fledged adventurer. With a partner by his side, the journey toward his goal may grow easier—or harder—depending on Karla's whims.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Simultaneously combating starvation, the lack of A/C, and the unavoidable weakness of turning child-sized, Jahy—previously the second strongest being in the Dark Realm—is under great stress. If it weren't for the destruction of the mana crystal which used to power the Dark Realm, Jahy would still be living a life of power and luxury. \n\nAnd yet, at the moment, brawling with the landlady over rent is a recurring event for Jahy. Just to have a place to stay and food to eat, Jahy must work part-time. However, her immense pride will not allow her to live under such poor conditions for any longer than necessary. Vowing to reinstate the Dark Realm to its former glory, Jahy continues her journey to reassemble the mana crystal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He wastes no time adjusting to his new environment, but soon realizes that he is using the skeleton avatar he chose when creating his character, which forces him to hide his visage to avoid unwanted attention.\n\nArc goes to the nearby castle town of Luvierte, hoping to become an adventurer and take on quests to earn money. With his overpowered abilities, Arc embarks on a fantastical journey—exploring diverse territories, looting various monsters, and helping people get out of sticky situations. However, his seemingly innocuous actions may soon involve him in a brewing large-scale conflict that will forever alter the fate of the realm.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Living in the ruins of a city long fallen, the three raise Will as their own. The skeleton— Blood—teaches him to fight; the ghost—Gus—teaches him magic; and the mummy—Mary—teaches him religion and responsibility. Most importantly, they all teach him love.      \n\nAs Will grows up and learns about the world he was born into, he prepares for the day when he must finally set out on his own. For Will, this journey includes a lifelong promise. At their coming-of-age, every adult is required to swear an oath to the god of their choice, with the strength of the pledge affecting the degree of their sworn god's blessing.\n\nWith his departure approaching, Will must prepare to accept the truth of his undead guardians and embark into a world that even they don't know the state of. Will discovers, however, that every oath must be fulfilled, one way or another.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While everyone is trying to lead a normal school life, the clash of bustling personalities causes many of the students to beg questions about their world and the complexes they brought with them.\n\nRyou Fujibayashi feels like her life is dictated by how she is judged by others, expressing her jealousy toward other girls. Yukito Kunisaki constantly finds himself out of place and neglected, continuing to wander around unemployed and penniless. Meanwhile, Ayu Tsukimiya keeps running into the most untimely of situations—all while crashing into her surroundings along the way. Such is life at Kaginado Academy, and all the fourth wall breaking and comedic antics that come with it!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The biggest ambition of every player is to become the King, whose peerless skills grant them near-total rule over the city.\n\nOne day, a young man wakes up in Neo Kyoto—with the knowledge of just his name, Teruto Kurabe, and carrying only a deck for a card game he no longer knows. Teruto soon encounters another player, Sakura Banka, who helps him remember both how to play Build Divide and his original mission: that no matter what, he must meet the King. Teaming up together, Teruto and Sakura find that their best chance for a royal audience is with the Rebuild tournament, where the one who collects twenty-one tokens from other competitors can challenge the King for their throne. However, as Teruto continues to play, he begins to regain his lost memories that call into question the very nature of Neo Kyoto.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since Nagomu Irino left his home to pursue his dream that ultimately failed. He finally decides to return after hearing that his father—owner of the Kyoto sweets store Ryokushou—has been hospitalized. Worrying that no one would inherit the shop if his father passes away, Nagomu prepares himself to embrace his family's legacy and the art of making sweets⁠.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nagomu discovers that his father has already chosen a different successor—a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira, who was abandoned at Ryokushou by her father for reasons unknown. While she has since become a part of the family and is now the shop's poster girl, Itsuka still longs to see her father and follows all possible clues that may lead her to him. Sympathizing with Itsuka's situation, Nagomu's mother asks Nagomu to act as Itsuka's father, hoping that Itsuka will open up to him and relieve her pain, even if just a little.\n\nStarting on bad terms, Itsuka and Nagomu gradually learn more about each other, realizing that they are more similar than they had thought. Connected by their mutual love for both Ryokushou and its confections, their relationship as child and father figure begins to make lives around them a little bit sweeter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their next joint assignment is to act in a play featuring a flamenco showdown, but Junta once again holds an advantage due to his ancestry and because Takato has never danced before. Fueled by his ceaseless desire to outshine Junta, Takato decides to travel to southern Spain and learn firsthand the passion needed to perform the demanding dance.\n\nIn the warm and friendly Spanish streets, Takato meets a wonderful flamenco dancer, an older handsome gentleman by the name of Ceres. Although Takato wishes to learn from him, his plans are soon interrupted by Junta's arrival in the area to visit his grandfather's hometown. Now, aside from struggling to reach Junta's skill level, Takato must also deal with Junta's family and face off against Antonio—an unexpected rival for Junta's love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
