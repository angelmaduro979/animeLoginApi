However, things aren't going well for him financially and after a customer leaves a green jacket behind, Yasuo starts adding to his income by walking the crowded streets of the Tokyo metroplex and stealing people's wallets. With this, he's able to buy his girlfriend a nice ring even though she says he didn't need to buy this for her.\nOver time, Yasuo becomes obsessed with becoming Lupin to the point that he reads and watches everything regarding him, he even works with Jigen for a time.\n\nHowever, when Yasuo learns of the Ice Cube diamond, he knows that if he can steal this, he will be the real Lupin.\n\n(Source: Lupin Wiki, edited)",

          "synopsis": "Moonlight Mask's identity has always been a mystery (which is why the Moonlight Mask persona is credited as being played by \"?\" in the original series).\n\nDecked out in white tights, white &amp; red cape, white scarf, yellow gloves &amp; boots, dark glasses, face cloth and Indian-style turban (pinned with a \"moon\" ornament), Moonlight Mask is armed with a whip, two six-shooters, shuriken and moon-shaped boomerangs. He also rides a motorcycle.\n\nHowever, only audiences know that Moonlight Mask could very well be detective Juurou Iwai who seems to disappear from his friends before the caped crusader rides to the rescue in his motorcycle! Even his comical assistant Gorohachi Fukuro, his friend Inspector Matsuda, and children Shigeru, Kaboko and Fujiko are oblivious to Iwai's secret identity.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "synopsis": "In California's Center City, shy but kindhearted Joseph Carter \"Joey\" Jones lives with his grandmother, working in a coffee shop. Though his family is financially burdened and he is bullied at school, he remains cheerful. A robotics enthusiast, he wants a top-of-the-line toy robot called a Heybo more than anything.\n\nOne day Joey and his friend Simon \"Psy\" Kaina come across a destroyed Heybo discarded by a group of rich kids. He takes it home and repairs it himself, excitedly naming it Heroman. However, one night Heroman is struck by lightning and comes to life, growing several times its size in the process.\n\nThat same night Center City is attacked by aliens called Skrugg whose attention was brought to Earth after Joey's acquaintance Professor Matthew Denton made attempts to contact them. Along with Joey, Heroman quickly heads to the scene of the attack, where he finds people in trouble, including his friend Lina Davis and her father. Using an arm-mounted controller, Joey is able to command Heroman to use superpowers to fight off the Skrugg and rescue civilians. As the aliens continue their invasion of Earth, the duo are the only ones separating humanity and destruction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
