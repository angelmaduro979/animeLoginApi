To investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond, Anya must either befriend his son Damian or collect eight Stella Stars to become an Imperial Scholar. Fortunately, Anya has already acquired her first star. In celebration, her adoptive father, Loid, decides to fulfill her wish to adopt a dog.\n\nDuring their canine search, Loid receives new orders from his superiors, who have found that a band of Berlint University students is plotting to assassinate Westalis' Minister Brantz using bombs worn by trained dogs. While Loid tries to stop their plans, Anya stumbles upon the terrorists' base of operations. There, she befriends a kindhearted, clairvoyant dog who the family later names Bond.\n\nAlthough the Forgers continue to lead their individual lives in secrecy, the family—with a new fluffy addition—remains united through all of the unusual obstacles thrown their way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Exorcist ninjas are tasked with protecting people from these spiteful spirits.\n\nMatsuri Kazamaki is a young exorcist ninja born to a prestigious clan. His childhood friend, Suzu Kanade, is an ayakashi medium—an individual with immense vitality that attracts ayakashi. Matsuri deems all ayakashi threatening and wishes to keep Suzu as far from them as possible, but this clashes with her desire to remain close to them. One day, the pair encounters Shirogane, the \"King of Ayakashi,\" who is hellbent on consuming Suzu. As she is about to be eaten, Matsuri comes to the rescue and manages to seal the ayakashi's powers—but not before Shirogane takes revenge by turning him into a girl!\n\nUntil he finds a way to transform back, Matsuri must adjust to his new, peculiar lifestyle while fighting against hostile ayakashi. Moreover, Suzu is now conflicted about her feelings toward Matsuri—further plunging their relationship into a state of ambiguity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although they have never encountered aliens before, Yuuhi is desperate to meet one as he believes that an alien has stolen his important item called the \"Earthdamar.\"\n\nOne day, while searching for extraterrestrial creatures, Yuuhi and Yuamu find a strange spot in the forest where many trees have fallen, forming a scenery similar to a crop circle. As they venture further, they discover a mysterious spaceship and enter it out of curiosity. To their surprise, they come across Yudias Velgear, an alien from the Velgear Star Cluster. As it turns out, Yudias is seeking to learn about Rush Duel—a card game popular among elementary school students—as he believes that it will save his home from a long war.\n\nWith the siblings agreeing to teach Yudias about Rush Duel, they eventually realize that their first contact with an alien may not be a random coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The adult Takemichi grapples with grief and the ramifications of the Tokyo Manji gang's criminal empire—an unintended product of his timeline meddling. Though the gang once operated under the idealistic Manjirou \"Mikey\" Sano, it has now been taken over by the malicious Tetta Kisaki and, as a result, has abandoned its original optimistic intent.\n\nDespite feeling hopeless, Takemichi travels to the past once again to investigate Black Dragon, a rival motorcycle gang whose actions ultimately lead to Hinata's demise. There, he meets the young Hakkai Shiba, a fellow gang member whose older brother, Taiju, tyrannically rules Black Dragon. When Taiju brutally beats Takemichi in a one-sided street brawl, Hakkai attempts to withdraw from Tokyo Manji in apology—an act that Takemichi must prevent to spare Hakkai a grim future.\n\nThrough a shared tragedy, Takemichi bonds with Chifuyu Matsuno, establishing a close comradery both boys desperately need. With Chifuyu on his side, Takemichi works to unravel the fates of Black Dragon's members, fighting to create a happy future for his loved ones.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, to achieve this, Senkuu must first build a ship.\n\nWith the help of Tsukasa Shishiou's former underlings, the base of the ship is rapidly assembled, but there is one missing piece: a skilled captain. During their search, Senkuu and his crew come across a petrified Ryuusui Nanami—the heir of the biggest maritime conglomerate, known for his vast knowledge of sailboats but unpleasant personality. Despite this, Senkuu takes the risk and revives Ryuusui.\n\nRyuusui, upon realizing there are no ownership rights in this new civilization, is excited at the prospect of claiming everything for himself. But before he agrees to play a crucial part in their upcoming journey and command the vessel through the restless seas, he and Senkuu must find the king of fuels to power the ship—oil.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With the war over, its infamous hero Hitokiri Battousai disappeared into thin air, leaving only his legend behind.\n\nYears later, a seemingly plain wanderer named Kenshin Himura encounters Kaoru Kamiya, the owner of a struggling local dojo in Tokyo. Kaoru pursues a self-proclaimed Battousai who roams the streets, indiscriminately killing citizens and police officers. Furthermore, the warrior professes to use the Kamiya Kasshin-ryu—a sword style developed by Kaoru's father deeply rooted in the essence of life, not death.\n\nKenshin decides to help Kaoru take down the impostor and restore her father's dojo. Unbeknownst to all, Kenshin is none other than the real warrior whose name still terrifies the people. Although Kaoru eventually learns the truth, his oath to atone for his murderous history by bloodlessly protecting the weak moves her, and she welcomes Kenshin to stay at her dojo. However, Kenshin's ideals are soon challenged by ghosts of the past and enemies of the present.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, he inadvertently summons a cowgirl named Bell from another world through a strange application on his smartphone. Bell soon starts to work as a farmer in Hiro's world while building a strong friendship with her summoner. Noticing that her summoner strongly dislikes milk despite his desire to grow taller, Bell offers him a kind that she knows he will love and help him grow.\n\nEpisode 2\nSingle and middle-aged Toru Negishi registers for a sexual pet website that is said to give its users a free beast girl. Asking for a catgirl while signing up, Negishi is surprised when his request is immediately accepted. Suddenly, a magic circle appears in his living room, summoning a catgirl in heat called Nia. Unluckily for her, she arrives from another world having just masturbated and, therefore, naked. Nia is initially displeased with what happened, but after living with Negishi for some time, she starts to feel sexually attracted toward him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With his wet nurse living in a border town, the wet nurse has been raising the prince quietly, and hoped that he could take up the task of restoring the country in the future. The name of family and country feelings: Xizitang. In the blink of an eye, Xizitang was eight years old, and was sent to Chuiyun Mountain by his wet nurse to practice. \n\nAfter practicing for ten years, I finally broke through the martial world and stepped into the fairyland with the hammer of the god of martial arts left by my ancestors, and with the momentum of a newborn calf that is not afraid of tigers, I vowed to hang the Eight Immortals and smash the Penglai Liberation Four. The continent is at peace. There are immortal cultivators all over the four continents, and Xi Zitang is just a younger brother. Under the identification of the town's immortal list, he received the certificate of Fanxian's inferior, but in today's Datang, even the job requirements for food delivery are Fanxian. Wait, how can this be good? After accumulating buffs for ten years, how will Xi Zitang, who has just entered the arena, set off a bloody storm in the arena?\n\n(Source: Tencent Video, translated)",

With no time to lose, Takeru aims to enlist Yuuko's help in his world to complete the Alternative IV project—the last hope humanity has against the BETA, an alien species invading the planet. As the anti-BETA project nears completion, Takeru and other cadets graduate from the Yokohama pilot training academy.\n\nHowever, during a test of the new operating system for the Tactical Surface Fighters—the giant combat suits used by humanity against their adversary—the BETA ambush Takeru and his team. Barely escaping with his life, Takeru is left traumatized after witnessing the cruel death of one of his close friends.\n\nLosing his will to fight, Takeru flees back to the other world, where he experiences a similar tragedy. According to Yuuko's theory, people from parallel universes are bound to suffer the same fate. As a result, Takeru must overcome his trauma if he wants to protect the ones he holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In 2060, in order to solve various supernatural crises, the World Organization selected elite agents from all over the world to form a crisis bureau. The Dangerous Situation selected the elites of the elite to form an ace squad, named the Phantom. Three years ago, in a task of receiving treasures, due to the gullibility of the captain, Hyway, the Phantom Squad was attacked by the Derek Squad, and almost all of them were killed in action. Hyway himself was planted by Derek and fell into the cliff. However, the target treasure, the Immortal Stone, accidentally entered into Haoyuan's body, bringing him back from the dead, gaining the ability to manipulate time, and possessing super powers such as time static and time reversal. Our protagonist has lived as a fugitive from then on. Haoyuan didn't want to face the past, and chose to remain anonymous, leading a plain life, and guarding Gu Xiaoxi, the sister of his comrade-in-arms. But God’s will, a blue virus appeared in City Y, and the infected person’s skin appeared blue, then spread all over the body little by little, and eventually died. And Gu Xiaoxi was also infected. In order to break the blue virus incident and save Gu Xiaoxi, Hyway returns to the crisis situation. With the sexy and capable secret agent Yu Jie-Xia Rou, the quirky genius Loli-Tong Xiaoxiao, and the second-biggest gangster-Zhan Peng and other weird celebrities make a makeshift to form an alternative phantom team. And our legendary story begins here. \n\n(Source:  Youku.com, rough translation)",

Unexpectedly, Nie Feng did not die because of this, but was reborn back to his boyhood at the age of seventeen. In this life, although he was from an ordinary background, he possessed peerless martial arts and rose rapidly in the martial arts. The regrets of the previous life will be made up.

But despite the colorful cast, the one character Kobayashi is most obsessed with is the villainess Lieselotte Riefenstahl. Contrary to her rude remarks toward Fiene, Lieselotte longs to be her friend. Lieselotte is also deeply in love with her own fiancé, Prince Siegwald Fitzenhagen—the game's main love interest. Unfortunately, in almost every route, Lieselotte is doomed to a tragic end.\n\nKobayashi manages to convince Endou to play MagiKoi to practice his speaking skills. What begins as a normal playthrough turns extraordinary when Siegwald suddenly hears the players' voices inside the game! Now labeled as \"gods,\" Endou and Kobayashi use their comments and analyses to save their beloved tsundere villainess from her fated demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
