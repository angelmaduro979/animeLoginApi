He works with his little assistant Pinoko (who has a massive crush on the doctor), dealing with medical cases not very well known, which can be strange, dangerous, or not known at all. But he is a genius, and can save almost any of his patients' life (as long as they have the money for it, that is), and is known to many around the world, especially to those of medicine and science. He's a man of science himself, and does not believe much until he has seen it, yet it is many times he is surprised by love and nature often overpowering the science he bases his life in.  \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Surprisingly, a young conductor named Tonoin Kei (known as a musical genius) joins this small orchestra to conduct. Even though Tonoin is a strict conductor, all the members adore him for the notable improvements in their performances and soon Yuuki feels his efforts for the orchestra have been fruitless. Yuuki soon comes to the conclusion that his crush of 3 years likes Tonoin, and he decides to give up on her and leave the orchestra. Tonoin refuses to let him quit, confessing that he loves Yuuki, which reveals that he's gay. Tonoin's love confession confuses Yuuki and it leads to a very horrible misunderstanding.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Despite all her setbacks while performing, she works hard and with the help and support of Takaaki Oiishi (the best male gymnast of her school) soon becomes a member of the rhythmic gymnastics team in her school. She develops feelings for Oiishi, but she is not the only one—Hazuki Shiina, the best gymnast in the entire school, also has feelings for Oiishi. Soon a friendship between Hikari and Shiina develops, but also a rivalry as well in the sport and for the love of Oiishi. Hikari is also torn between her feelings for Oiishi and her conflicting feelings for Mao Natsukawa, an old childhood friend, who is also the lead singer of the band called Mr. D. He composes the music she uses while performing, and has been developing feelings for her since childhood.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Dai is the only human living on the island. Having been raised by the kindly monster Brass, Dai's dream is to grow up to be a hero. He gets to become one when Hadlar is resurrected and the previous hero, Avan, comes to train Dai to help in the battle. But Hadlar, announcing that he now works for an even more powerful demon lord, comes to kill Avan. To save his students Avan uses a Self-Sacrifice spell to attack, but is unable to defeat Hadlar. When it seems that Dai and Avan's other student Pop are doomed a mark appears on Dai's forehead and he suddenly gains super powers and is able to fend off Hadlar.
