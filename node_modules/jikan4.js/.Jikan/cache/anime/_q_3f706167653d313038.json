          "synopsis": "In In the year 2113 A.D., a team of scientists is dispatched to Antarctica to investigate the region's abnormal seismic activity. Near the epicenter of the activity, the expedition discovers vast land markings akin to the Nazca paleoglyphs drawn in the Peruvian desert. Stranger still is the presence of an enormous underground cavern below these symbols. At the bottom of the chasm, a portion of a tremendous tower juts from the ground. Armed with ultra-digital cameras, the scientific team transmits their findings to the Command Center. One explorer traces the image of a star chart engraved on the tower's exterior. The tower begins to emit a sinister howling as if possessed by demonic forces. One by one, the members of the expedition writhe in pain and die. Those observing the scene at the Command Center watch helplessly. As the high-frequency noise suffuses their headquarters, they too succumb and die in agony. When the waves of the frequency are analyzed, they are discovered to be a beacon directed at the planet Elysium, which lies beyond Earth's solar system.\n\nVan, the reluctant hero of the story, is an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy in Manhattan. He competes in the most popular sport of the 22nd century -- turbo jai alai racing. These races are fast paced and deadly affairs that integrate virtual reality into the competition. He's deeply in love with Lydia, a talented ballerina. In the chaotic futuristic metropolis, they only have each other and their dreams. Van and Lydia desperately want the chance to escape the polluted city-scape. Despite the dangers, Van enters a turbo jai alai race in the hopes of winning first prize -- two tickets to a galactic resort where Lydia can audition for the Jupiter Ballet.\n\nMeanwhile, earth's deep space observation vessel, the Odyssey, patrols the planet's orbital perimeter. The Odyssey is confronted by an armada of sophisticated alien spacecraft from Elysium. The awed human crew prepares to receive the Elysian ambassador, Yaspe. Without warning, the Odyssey loses control of its weapons, fires on the ambassador's vessel and destroys it. This tragic misunderstanding results in brutal retaliation by the Elysian fleet, culminating in the destruction of the Odyssey and a full-scale attack on Earth.\n\nVan's deadly sport of choice turns deadlier when the stadium he is competing in comes under fire from the Elysian barrage. Van struggles through the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia from the collapsing stands. The indiscriminate Elysian onslaught scorches cities worldwide. Van and Lydia flee through the burning streets of Manhattan seeking safety. After a series of harrowing escapes, they find refuge in a claustrophobic fall-out shelter. \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

Even though there are some things that can't be captured with a pencil and paper, she still brings her sketchbook wherever she goes. Her love of drawing eventually leads her to join her school's art club, despite her shy and childish personality.\n\nJust like herself, all of Sora's fellow art club members have their own vivid imagination and personality to match. Through her interactions with the rest of the club, Sora begins to break out of her shell and see more of the world around her, taking every opportunity to sketch whatever is on her mind or in her heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Through rape, manipulation and torture, they uncover important details, but piecing the puzzle together won't be easy.

Unwittingly, that rose can cause all wishes to become true, whether good or bad. Good wishes will turn the rose white and bloom, while bad wishes will turn the rose black and wither. After a heated argument with her sister Doremi, Pop wishes that Doremi loses all her magic and be turned into a mouse. Hilarity ensues, as Doremi and the others try to put everything back to normal.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

After being swindled by her landlord, Tanukichi, into working for his delivery service, it is not long before Ai meets other village residents: Kotobuki, the mayor perpetually worried about his reelection; Yuu, the only other human around, with a passion for random antics and costumes; Bouquet, an overly energetic but rather friendly cat; and Sally, an elephant who dreams of being a fashion designer. New friends seem to lurk in every nook and cranny, but despite that, Ai still struggles to find her niche in this town—until some mysterious notes left on the beach give her a glimpse of a greater purpose.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Denied their swords and stature, they are now treated as an object of pity and utter disregard while the Amanto mercilessly terrorizes the country.\n\nTo restore the reputation of the samurai, the Anti-Foreigner Faction leader Kotarou Katsura resolves to eradicate the Amanto—even if he must resort to violent methods. With a giant mecha at his disposal, he plans to initiate an attack against the Shinsengumi, an army of skillful samurai dedicated to protecting the peace of Edo.\n\nMeanwhile, Yorozuya owner Gintoki Sakata and his friends are out to see the cherry blossoms. However, they are interrupted when the Shinsengumi show up, claiming Gintoki has stolen their spot for flower-viewing. Quickly spiraling into a frenzied quarrel, the two groups settle the fight through a game of rock-paper-scissors—albeit with rather brutal methods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tifa Lockhart opens a new bar, and her childhood friend Cloud Strife starts up a motorcycle-based courier service. Although most of their former allies have fallen out of touch, Cloud and Tifa live in fragile peace with their two young wards Marlene and Denzel.\n\nTheir life together begins to crumble as a contagious plague and overwhelming grief pull Cloud away from his newfound family. While distancing himself through his work, Cloud is attacked by three silver-haired figures in black uniforms who bear a passing resemblance to his bitter rival, Sephiroth. As the antagonistic trio stalks Cloud and brings harm to his loved ones, the former mercenary struggles against his own demons while fighting to protect his family and prevent the will of Sephiroth from returning to the planet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To beat her competitors, this crafty woman will resort to even the shadiest, most questionable methods. She has eyes only for fame and fortune, with everything—and everyone—else being secondary.\n\nDuring a slow week, Etsuko catches wind of an ongoing hostage situation: Marude Damesuke has recently been fired and is seeking revenge by taking out his anger on his former boss' daughter, Mayumi Wakabayashi. Etsuko hurries to the scene, but is upset to discover that the situation between Damesuke and the police has reached a standstill. With both sides too afraid to take action, Etsuko creates her own scenario—even if it means using her body and the lives of others.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Of course, Anastasia sometimes can't resist using her magic to help her get through the trials and tribulations of everyday life, and her powerful mother is still a bad witch. But what this really means for Anastasia is that she needs to channel her sperm-powered sex magic to fight off her psychotic lesbian mother and her army of crazed sex slaves and demons! \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The film used footage from the films Digimon Adventure (1999), Our War Game!! (2000), and Digimon Hurricane Touchdown!! / Supreme Evolution!! The Golden Digimentals (2000). In comparison to the original films, Digimon: The Movie had a significant degree of editing, with more than 40 minutes of scenes from the individual Japanese versions cut out to save time and several plot changes.

Something so nightmarish that it stripped all memory from Mari Wakatake's mind even as it left every other human on the island dead in its wake! Now enrolled against her will at an isolated girl's academy, Mari is unaware that hidden eyes are watching her, waiting for her memory to return. \n\nBuried in her psyche is the most terrifying secret of all: while Mari was the only human who lived, she may not have been the only survivor! As something in a female skin invades Kaihou Academy, Mari's only hope may lie in a strange girl to whom she is inexplicably drawn yet cannot trust. \n\n(Source: Sentai Filmworks)",

Yet as years go by and the villagers become more self-sufficient, Holo has been reduced to a mere folktale. When a traveling merchant named Kraft Lawrence stops at the settlement, Holo offers to become his business partner if he takes her to her northern home of Yoitsu. The savvy trader recognizes Holo's unusual ability to evaluate a person's character and accepts her proposition. \n\nNow in the possession of both sharp bargaining skills and a charismatic negotiator, Lawrence inches closer to his goal of opening his own shop. However, as Lawrence travels the countryside with Holo in search of economic opportunities, he begins to realize that his aspirations are slowly morphing into something unexpected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
