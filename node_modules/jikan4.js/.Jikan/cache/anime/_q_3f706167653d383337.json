          "synopsis": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution has led to the development of cutting-edge technologies that have rapidly evolved the world. As a result, schools have begun incorporating these technologies into their curriculum, leaving behind the ways of the old. One such institution is the elite Yuyu Girls' Vocational High School, where both Serufu Yua and her childhood friend, Miku \"Purin\" Suride, have applied. Although the tech-savvy Purin is accepted to Yuyu High, the accident-prone Serufu is rejected and enters the traditional Gatagata Girls' High School instead, driving a wedge into their friendship.\n\nOn her way to class one day, Serufu gets into a bike accident, and Rei Yasaku, a passerby who attends the same school, fixes her damaged bicycle. Serufu later finds out that Rei has a passion for old-fashioned crafts and is the head of the school's Do-It-Yourself (DIY) Club—which is in danger of closing due to a lack of members.\n\nRealizing that this may be her chance to repair her relationship with Purin, Serufu joins the club in hopes of creating projects that could bring them together once more. As the DIY Club welcomes new faces, Serufu learns to build not only handicrafts but also new friendships along the way!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thanks to the revival of a skillful chef, enough food is being prepared for the entire crew, and the incredible reinvention of the GPS promises to ensure safety on the open sea.\n\nPreparations for the upcoming journey progress swimmingly until Senkuu receives an eerie message from a mysterious source. More driven than ever, the scientist sets out to explore the new world and discover what it can offer for his scientific cause. Though the uncharted territories may hide unkind surprises, Senkuu, with a little help from science, is ready to take on any challenge.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Ever since she was young, Komichi Akebi has always adored sailor uniforms, even going so far as to ask her mother to sew one if she succeeds in getting into her mother's alma mater, Roubai Academy. And thus, when she gets accepted into the prestigious school, Komichi is ecstatic. However, much to her surprise, the middle school no longer uses sailor uniforms as its dress code—making Komichi stand out from her schoolmates. Despite this, Komichi is granted permission to continue wearing the traditional attire. \n\nWith renewed confidence, Komichi meets fascinating classmates as they experience school life together. Under the colorful shower of blossoming prospects, an exciting tomorrow awaits them!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The United States of America has been in chaos ever since the emergence of D2s, an invasive species originating from a black meteorite that fell to Earth. A public decree banned citizens from playing any melodies, to prevent further casualties caused by the D2s' hatred for music—even now, in 2047, this prohibition is still in effect. Humanity's only form of defense against the D2s are Musicarts, young women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones controlling them.\n\nTakt Asahina, an aloof piano prodigy, finds himself transformed into a Conductor following a spontaneous D2 attack. The same incident kills Anna Schneider's younger sister, Cosette, and brings Takt into contact with his Musicart, Destiny. Searching for a means of stabilizing the pact between themselves, Takt and Destiny—alongside Anna—embark on a perilous journey to the Symphonica Headquarters in New York City.\n\nTakt is in a hurry to reach the city so that he can play the piano again, even though his passion attracts the creatures he has come to despise. Meanwhile, Destiny's sense of duty drags the group into trouble along the way. With a D2-infested path and many more arduous obstacles ahead of them, will the trio make it to New York City in one piece?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Takt Op. Destiny is a mixed-media project centered on classical music, created by Bandai Namco Arts and DeNA. Under the same umbrella, a Japanese RPG for smartphones is being developed by Game Studio. The game, titled Takt Op. Unmei wa Akaki Senritsu no Machi o, was made available for pre-registration in March 2021 and was originally announced to be released by the end of the same calendar year before being delayed to 2022 and then again to 2023. A beta test was held in April 2023 and the game is set to be released on June 28th a few months after.",

          "synopsis": "Violent misfortunes frequently occur around 16-year-old Yuuta Okkotsu, a timid victim of high school bullying. Yuuta is saddled with a monstrous curse, a power that dishes out brutal revenge against his bullies. Rika Orimoto, Yuuta's curse, is a shadow from his tragic childhood and a potentially lethal threat to anyone who dares wrong him.\n\nYuuta's unique situation catches the attention of Satoru Gojou, a powerful sorcerer who teaches at Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School. Gojou sees immense potential in Yuuta, and he hopes to help the boy channel his deadly burden into a force for good. Yet Yuuta struggles to find his place among his talented classmates: the selectively mute Toge Inumaki, weapons expert Maki Zenin, and Panda.\n\nYuuta clumsily utilizes Rika on missions with the other first-year students, but the grisly aftermath of Rika's tremendous displays of power draws the interest of the calculating curse user Suguru Getou. As Getou strives to claim Rika's strength and use it to eliminate all non-jujutsu users from the world, Yuuta fights alongside his friends to stop the genocidal plot.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Vampires have existed for centuries and live under the rule of the Scarlet Moon. Once a year, \"Visual Prison\" occurs, a visual kei competition where the vampire who sings the most beautiful song is bestowed with great power by the Scarlet Moon. At the forefront of the competition are ECLIPSE—the reigning champions who stand for an established order, and LOST EDEN—a group that believes the strongest should rule.\n\nAnge Yuki is a lonely boy with no confidence in his singing ability. He moves to Harajuku in search of a musician he idolizes, but during his quest, he gets entangled in one of the many live performance clashes between ECLIPSE and LOST EDEN. Their fascinating stages stun him, but he soon collapses, overcome by bloodlust. Regaining consciousness, Ange finds himself under the care of Guiltia \"Guil\" Brion, the musician he admires, and learns that he is a dhampir—half-human, half-vampire.\n\nWhile Ange now has the privilege of participating in the upcoming Visual Prison, Guil explains that he will not join him in this endeavor. Meanwhile, Ange encounters Robin Laffite, a foreigner from England who is enamored by his astonishing singing voice. With the day of the competition slowly creeping up, Ange has to put together a capable unit in an exciting race against time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Vladilena Milizé continues to operate as \"Handler One,\" the commander of yet another dehumanized 86th faction's squadron in the continuous war against the Legion.\n\nOn the Western Front, Shinei Nouzen and his squad are quarantined in a military base controlled by the Federal Republic of Giad, formerly known as the Giadian Empire. The newly-established government grants the saved Eighty-Six full citizenship and freedom. Housed by the president Ernst Zimmerman himself, the group meets his adoptive daughter and the last Empress, Augusta Frederica Adel-Adler.\n\nHowever, within the calm of this tender society, Shinei and his team feel that their purpose is on the battlefield. Before long, they are once again in the midst of the Legion's onslaught as a part of the Federacy's Nordlicht Squadron, accompanied by Augusta Frederica. But, as history repeats itself, they realize that no matter the side, death and pain on the front lines are the only comfort they know.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
