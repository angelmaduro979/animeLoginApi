          "synopsis": "As the fourth in a series of activities to promote and raise awareness of the Manga-Anime Guardians Project (MAGP), a new \"Stop! Piracy\" clip featuring the characters from the Sgt. Frog anime franchise has been produced. In Japan, the anti-piracy video series featuring a camera-headed character named \"Eiga Dorobou\" (Movie Thief) is shown before every movie screening. In this clip, Eiga Dorobou performs with Keroro, who is trying to access pirated anime and manga without knowing its illegality, along with his friends.\n\nMAGP was launched in July 2013 in order for manga publishers and animation-related companies to cross-sectionally share information on piracy in Japan and abroad, investigate the actual situation, and take countermeasures. This new \"Stop! Piracy\" video was produced to inform the public that the illegal downloading of infringing content, which was previously limited to movies and music works, now covers all copyrighted works due to the revised Copyright Act, which came into effect on January 1, 2021. The clip will be screened in 75 theaters in the Kanto area from December 24. \n\n(Source: Crunchyroll)",

Pointing out its many absurdities, she proposes that the academy is actually a stand-in for the afterlife.\n\nYuri's theory makes everyone restless; some begin questioning and even second-guessing their own memories. However, not all agree with the notion, defending the fact that their current existence is a result of their past rather than the interference of an omniscient being. Life at Kaginado Academy continues to be frenetic—despite how much the students want it to be otherwise!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "As electric vehicles dominate everyday life in the 2020s, interest in traditional combustion engine cars is maintained through a motorsports series known as the MFG. Hundreds of ambitious drivers, with a staggering 30 million viewers online, fiercely compete for a spot in the Godly Fifteen—the leading 15 racers—and a chance at the grand prize of 100 million yen. Among these individuals aiming for the top is 19-year-old Kanata Rivington.\n\nHaving attended a famous racing school in England, Kanata sets his sights on the upcoming MFG tournament and enrolls in the competition under the alias \"Kanata Katagiri.\" In comparison to his opponents' flashy vehicles, Kanata's Toyota 86 GT, passed down from a former MFG contestant, puts him at a considerable disadvantage. Kanata receives guidance from a Godly Fifteen member, but he still treats the MFG as only a stepping stone for his true goal: locating his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kanata's appearance sends shockwaves through the scene as his driving style eerily resembles that of a once legendary racer.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The number of terrorist acts in Japan has never been lower, thanks to the efforts of a syndicate called Direct Attack (DA). The organization raises orphaned girls as killers to carry out assassinations under their \"Lycoris\" program. Takina Inoue is an exceptional Lycoris with a strong sense of purpose and a penchant for perfection. Unfortunately, a hostage situation tests her patience, and the resulting act of insubordination leads to her transfer out of DA. Not thrilled about losing the only place she belonged to, she reluctantly arrives at her new base of operations—LycoReco, a cafe in disguise.\n\nTakina's new partner, however, turns out to be quite different from what she imagined. Despite being the famed Lycoris prodigy, Chisato Nishikigi appears almost unconcerned with her duties. She drags Takina along on all kinds of odd jobs under the simple explanation of helping people in need. Takina is even more puzzled when Chisato takes down a group of armed assailants without killing any of them. Feeling like a fish out of water, Takina itches to get reinstated into DA—but Chisato is determined to prove to her that there is more to a life than just taking them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The \"lucky\" person selected happens to be the lustful and unlucky high schooler Ataru Moroboshi. Given 10 days to attempt to grab Lum's horns, Ataru realizes how impossible the challenge is as he is faced with Lum's extraterrestrial powers.\n\nMotivated by a promise of marriage from his childhood friend Shinobu Miyake, Ataru manages to catch Lum off guard. He mistakenly grabs hold of her bikini top first, but he eventually achieves his true goal. Although the game is over, Lum misunderstands that she is the one whom Ataru wants to marry, and she decides to move in with him. The poor student constantly tries to shake off the clingy Lum while doing his best to reconcile with his desired fiancée. After Ataru's heroic feat results in such a disastrous outcome, it is questionable whether luck will ever be on his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
