In this town, where the rules strictly forbid asking about the past or getting to know people, there is small detective agency called S&amp;A Detectives. \n\nThe story revolves around Ayamana, the inseparable pair of misfit wannabe detectives, the case Manami takes on impulse, and the trouble that arises from it. On the case they find a woman who is abnormally hot, and who is being chased by a bunch of women with guns. After being dubbed Sara, the detectives try and figure out just what is going on with her. At the same time, all over town teenage girls are burning up and turning into glass. The government is covering everything up, but the detectives, as well as a nosy reporter and the local police, are determined to find out what is happening.",

          "synopsis": "A film produced for Toei's 20th anniversary. A boy who is the descendant of the leader of the theives who met a grisly fate in the 1001 Nights bands together with 38 cats and a mouse to get back his rightful treasure from Ali Baba XXXIII, the descendent of Ali Baba who now rules the kingdom with an iron fist. This is a reversal of the good guy/bad guy roles in the original story! (perhaps not surprising for being a film in which Hayao Miyazaki was involved) This film is one of the most rollicking and action-packed films made by Toei, and is in an outrageously cartoonish style breaking with the Toei mold. It has a spectacular lineup of animators including Yasuji Mori, Akira Daikubara, Hayao Miyazaki, Yoichi Kotabe and Reiko Okuyama. The original story about Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves itself is recounted at one point in the film in an unexpected and interesting way using shadow-puppets. \n\n(Source: pelleas.net)",

However, they learn that there is only one doctor left on the island, the reclusive Dr. Kureha who currently resides at the top of a mountain. With a sick Nami in tow, Monkey D. Luffy and Sanji set out on an arduous journey to seek her help. \n\nMeanwhile, the return of Wapol—Drum Island's former king—and his brother spells trouble for the island's inhabitants. As the one responsible for the current lack of doctors, Wapol has finally returned to take back his position as the people's despot and absolute ruler.\n\nWith the help of new allies like the half-human reindeer Chopper Tony Tony, the Straw Hat Crew must overcome all the obstacles in its way to save Nami's life and stop Wapol from plunging Drum Island back into tyranny. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

          "synopsis": "In the future, a new MRI technology analyzes the brains of deceased crime victims and eyewitnesses within 48 hours of their death to extract images of their memories. Although this cutting-edge technology is responsible for solving various murder cases, it has raised several ethical concerns, placing Section Nine—the police division in charge of the MRI investigations led by Tsuyoshi Maki—under considerable pressure from the media and the government. The team members of Section Nine are not only forced to witness traumatic events through the eyes of both victims and murderers, but they also need to negotiate with the victims' families, whose consent is required for the post-mortem MRI scans.\n\nFreshly graduated from the police academy, Ikkou Aoki joins Section Nine to replace Maki's best friend Katsuhiro Suzuki—a former member who passed away under ambiguous circumstances after watching MRI footage from a particularly morbid criminal case. As a stream of seemingly unrelated events creeps closer to the case of Suzuki's death, Section Nine will have to face its greatest challenge to date, threatening its very existence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
