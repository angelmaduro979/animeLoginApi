Noelle is horrified when, on the very night of her parents' funeral, the stepbrother she remembered so fondly cruelly rapes her. Then, without explaining why, Shuichi forces Noelle to transfer to the prestigious Takamine College. \n\nEach night as he ravishes her body, Shuichi pumps Noelle for information about the women on campus. Women like the curvaceously timid Haruko, the sexually talented Shirone, and the beautiful blond-haired bombshell Elena... Women who will be able to satisfy his insatiable desires – and provide him with the information he needs to avenge the death of his mother.",

          "synopsis": "Three TV Specials complied from Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED series.\n\n1. The Empty Battlefield (Kokuu no Senjou)\n2. The Far-Away Dawn (Harukanaru Akatsuki)\n3. The Rumbling Sky (Meidou no Sora)\n\nMuch like the Kidou Senshi Gundam theatrical movies, the Gundam Seed: Special Edition movies are intended to be an override of the story from the TV series.\n\nThese episodes are in fact a complete recap of all 50 episodes of the TV series and were first shown on television in Japan. The special edition episodes feature some new scenes and tweaks to previously animated scenes. The first special, The Empty Battlefield, which compiled episodes 1–21 of the series, was aired in two parts on Japanese TV in March 2004, followed by the next special, The Far-Away Dawn, which was episodes 22–40, in July 2004. The final special, The Rumbling Sky, which was episodes 41–50. While the story is overall unchanged, there are a few minor changes. In addition, several scenes are re-animated and re-dubbed.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

As mankind enters a new era of unity and prosperity, four of the five Gundam pilots decide to follow in society's footsteps and disarm by launching their mobile suits into the sun. However, their plan is unexpectedly suspended when a rebellion erupts with the emergence of Mariemaia Khushrenada—who claims to be the child of fallen dictator Treize and desires to conquer the world in his stead.\n\nDeciding that they are the last line of defense for the Earth Sphere, Heero Yuy, Trowa Barton, Duo Maxwell, and Quatre Raberba Winner scramble to retrieve their Gundams and fight to protect the peace the people of the colonies have pursued for so long. Despite their unwavering resolve to complete one final mission, the battle will be challenging: the pilots' former ally Wufei Chang has pledged his allegiance to Mariemaia's cause instead.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Along the way, he teams up with a company of bandit mice and Pierre, a gentle orphan who has been cheated out of his inheritance.\n\nWhen Pero learns that Princess Rose is seeking a husband, he becomes determined to make sure that Pierre is the one chosen. However, Princess Rose is forcibly betrothed to the wicked ogre Lucifer! Pero begins to spin a web of lies to enthrall Rose with Pierre, but Pero's boasts are far from the truth. Pierre has to keep up with Pero's bold image of him but is frightened, because while Princess Rose is charming, loving her means going against the Devil's wishes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This request was probably made to see how the Bible would be depicted by the non-Christian Tezuka Osamu. Tezuka Osamu accepted the request and spent an entire two years to complete a pilot film. It was about the mythology of Noah's ark, with the enthusiastic Tezuka Osamu not only writing the scenario but also drawing pictures by himself. During production, however, he unfortunately passed away, so Director Dezaki took over the film and completed it.\n\n(Source: official homepage)",

One morning Nagisa comes across a woman dressed in a strange uniform who seems to stare at her, unnerving Nagisa. Later that day, whilst staring out the window, Nagisa becomes aware of a ball bouncing by itself which flings itself towards her window seat, shattering the glass yet not harming her... Turning back to the front she finds a gaping mouth bristling with teeth inches from her face and no-one else about. She screams and the world returns to normal with her standing and the centre of curiosity of her class... why did she scream?",

It covers the same basic elements of these chapters; Genesis of the guyver, Fight with Vamore, Fight with Guyver 2 and the introduction of Guyver 3. Main differences are the exclusion of Tetsuro and his replacement by Mizuki, The replacement of Lisker with a female Agent \"Valcuria\", and thus a female Guyver 2. There is also a look at Sho's psychology of how he deals with his situation including a very harsh moment where his friends are assassinated in cold blood.\n\nOne night, high school student Sho Fukamachi discovers a mysterious metal object. Then in a blinding flash of light, Sho finds that he has accidentally fused with the Guyver, a mecha of mysterious alien design.\n\nNow, to save his girlfriend, Mizuki Segawa, along with the entire world, Sho must become the Guyver to fight the Chronos Corporation and their biocreatures, called Zoanoids, who are hell-bent on world domination.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
