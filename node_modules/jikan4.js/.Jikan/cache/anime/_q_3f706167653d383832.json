After returning to Japan, he becomes the leader of a baseball team of juvenile delinquents and meets his eternal rival, Hyuuma Hoshi. After going to Koshien, the two rivals join Tigers and Giants respectively as professional players. They face-off against each other as they continue to improve their skills, Hyuuma as a pitcher who throws \"Big League\" balls and Hanagata as an aggressive player.\n\n(Source: TMS)",

          "synopsis": "In the cyber city Tom Sawyer, society revolves around earning \"Love,\" akin to receiving likes on social media. Citizens of this augmented reality exchange Love for public services and appearance-changing avatars via the Decoration Customizer, also known as \"Deco,\" a hologram device implanted in an individual's eyes from early childhood. Under the government's careful management, the people of Tom Sawyer live a peaceful existence, outside the occasional appearance of Phantom Zero, a mysterious criminal who brings all Love to zero within their vicinity.\n\nBerry, a mischievous girl fascinated by Phantom Zero, lives comfortably in the system of Tom Sawyer until her Deco malfunctions, enabling her to see a camouflaged prankster named Hack. Believing Hack to be Phantom Zero, Berry chases after the suspect and, in the process, begins to uncover society's most well-kept secrets. As it turns out, Hack is not the only person living outside the system's rules—and the vibrant colors of Tom Sawyer hide a darker nature.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Almost immediately after their return, the first-year students of Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School face yet another special exam, with both class and individual points on the line.\n\nIn addition to the complicated ruleset, more issues arise in the form of Kakeru Ryuuen and Kei Karuizawa. Angered by the previous test's outcome, Ryuuen is dead set on outdoing every class in the new challenge using any means necessary. Meanwhile, Karuizawa, a crucial pillar of Class D, is close to crumbling under the pressure of her past.\n\nThe stage is now set for Kiyotaka Ayanokouji to once again—using the full extent of his planning, foresight, and ruthless manipulation—steer Class D to victory as dangerously close enemy forces try to bring it down.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Ittoki Sakuraba fails to understand why his mother, his uncle, and his childhood friend, Kousetsu, seem to take his security so seriously. Kousetsu constantly follows and observes him with no regard for his privacy, focusing only on keeping him safe every waking moment. But the consistent hounding starts making sense when an adorable second-year student at his high school, Satomi Tsubaki, asks Ittoki out on a date. Though initially innocent, Tsubaki's true intentions soon become apparent when Ittoki visits her house; she plans to assassinate him, and she is not alone. Surprisingly, the ones who come to his aid are his uncle and Kousetsu—donning their dark and deadly ninja attire. \n\nAfter Ittoki is escorted to safety, his mother reveals the truth: he is the 19th heir to a noble clan of ninjas known as the Iga, and the target of assassination by their rival clan, the Koga. In order to protect himself against this new threat, Ittoki must hone his skills at the only ninja academy remaining in Japan: the Kokuten Ninja Academy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In a tranquil neighborhood of Tokyo, seven students are avoiding going to school—hiding in their darkened bedrooms, unable to face their family and friends—until the moment they find the mirrors in their bedrooms are shining.\n\nAt a single touch, they are pulled from their lonely lives into a wondrous castle straight out of a Grimm's fairy tale. This whimsical place, oddly lacking in food and running water but full of electrical sockets, is home to a petulant girl in a mask, named Wolf Queen and becomes their playground and refuge during school hours. Hidden within the walls, they're told there's a key that will grant one wish, as well as a set of clues to find it. But there's a catch: the key must be found by the end of the school year and they must leave the premises by five o'clock each day or else suffer a fatal end.\n\nAs time passes, a devastating truth emerges: only those brave enough to share their stories will be saved. And so they begin to unlock each other's stories: how a boy is showered with more gadgets than love; how another suffers a painful and unexplained rejection, and how a girl lives in fear of her predatory stepfather. As they struggle to abide by the rules of the game, a moving story unfolds, of seven characters trapped in a cycle of misunderstanding and loneliness, who are ultimately set free by the power of friendship, empathy, and sacrifice. \n\n(Source: Erewhon Books, edited)",

According to local folklore, centuries ago, one of the villagers made a promise with the wolf deity Holo, who swore to bless Pasloe with bountiful harvests of wheat. Yet, as time passed, such stories became little more than relics of the past.\n\nAfter quickly finishing his business in the village, Lawrence sets out to his next destination. His journey, however, takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a nude, animal-eared girl sleeping among his pelts. Even more surprisingly, the youthful-looking woman claims to be Holo—the wolf of legend.\n\nHolo wishes to return to her hometown in the north, and though their first encounter is rocky, she convinces Lawrence to accompany her on her travels. In return, she vows to earn her keep, using her quick wits and lifetime of experience to help her newfound companion in his dealings. As they continue their journey, Lawrence and Holo take advantage of whatever economic opportunities they come across, often landing in situations that put both their business skills and their relationship to the test.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Turning your hands into clouds and covering your hands into rain, while talking and laughing, the powerful enemies are wiped out. My wish is very simple. It is nothing more than planting flowers and raising grass, and making bubble girls and refining treasures. Covering the world with one hand, very good and powerful. Liang Xi looked at the sentient beings in the seven realms crawling under her feet, and emphasized that I am a man with a strong sense of chastity.\n\n(Source: Donghua Sub Studio)",
