She is practical, strong, yet darkly cynical. Instead of the tradition story, Alice is kidnapped unwillingly by a mysterious (yet somewhat bishie-looking) man with bunny ears into a place call Heartland. Stuck in Heartland due to a trick by the mysterious bunny eared man, she meets the residents of this world. Along the way, Alice meets Blood, handsome mafia leader; Ace, the psycho yet charming knight and more... What should Alice do in such a world!?\n\n(Source: MU)",

As a masked avenger, he collaborates with his uncle, a former surgeon, to dispense his brand of justice on behalf of clients who seek the assistance of their business, \"Rapeman Services.\" Be it exacting vengeance on an ex-lover, mending the relationship between a daughter and her parents, or suppressing the anger of a disgruntled employee, Keisuke never falters in completing his assigned contracts. Whenever corrupt women wander, the Rapeman arrives to forcibly change their sullied hearts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For one woman warrior however, an early defeat clearly shows her that she is lacking in experience though she may be bountiful in body.\n\nFortunately, while defeat could spell one's doom, her life is saved by a powerful stranger. But unfortunately for this savior, less-than-pure motives and shrewd family members mean her reward is a prison cell. Her release is prompt when the unseasoned warrior she saved, tired of her current lifestyle of nobility, sets off to prove herself.\n\n(Source: Media Blasters)",

Touya Fujii is a normal college student with normal worries—namely balancing his classes and his job he works to pay for school. He is also concerned about the amount of time he has to spend with Yuki Morikawa, or rather, the lack of it.\n\nBeing an up and coming idol singer, Yuki has concerns of her own. Even though she's not yet as popular as experienced veteran Rina Ogata, Yuki is turning heads and landing interviews on television. This should be a good thing, but not everyone is happy about the attention she receives from the media and from Rina. The idol industry is surprisingly cutthroat, and rival singers have their eyes on Yuki.\n\nWhile it may seem exciting to watch your girlfriend on television, how does Touya really feel about all this? Between the challenges associated with Yuki's career and other people that Touya meets at his university, their relationship may not last…",

She never complains about her way of life, as she is deeply infatuated with Shou and would go to the ends of the world for him. However, her heart is broken when she overhears Shou talk about how he views her as nothing more than a maid he cares little for. \n\nAngered over being used, Kyouko flies into a rage and swears to get revenge on her former crush by entering the world of showbiz to surpass him. Joining the relentless and unforgiving entertainment industry proves to be a challenge, as she continuously meets people who force her out of her comfort zone. But for the sake of vengeance, Kyouko is determined to push herself and rise to the top.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In Japan, there exists a government agency known as the Supernatural Disaster Countermeasures Division (SDCD), whose duty is to protect the citizens from creatures unseen. They are able to dispatch these monsters swiftly and without alerting the general public. But currently, they face a different challenge: the betrayal of one of their own.\n\nAfter the death of her mother several years ago, Kagura Tsuchimiya has been fostered by the Isayama family and forms a close sister-like bond with their daughter Yomi. The two become inseparable, and together they work for the SDCD as highly skilled exorcists. However, as the stress and consequences of their sacred duty weigh on them both, and family politics come into play, Kagura and Yomi begin to slowly drift apart. One of them grows earnestly into her role as an exorcist, and the other heads down a dark path from which there may be no redemption.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Fubuki Momose, an athletic high school girl, is in love with the seemingly apathetic Shinichi Kawahara. Unbeknownst to her, Shinichi shares the same sentiment but hesitates to convey his true emotions. The state of their relationship changes dramatically when an earthquake causes their school building to collapse—trapping four students inside. Confined alongside Fubuki and Shinichi are Takaaki Tsumura, Shinichi's promiscuous best friend, and the younger and unfamiliar Mizuha Senju, who also harbors feelings for Shinichi.\n\nDetermined to find a way out, the four divide into two pairs to search for an exit. Fubuki soon confesses her love to Shinichi, which he immediately reciprocates. Although their romance seemed destined to blossom, Fubuki's heart is thrown into disarray after Takaaki accuses Shinichi of sexually assaulting Mizuha. As her suspicion only continues to grow, Fubuki finds herself being manipulated by Takaaki while Shinichi remains on the sidelines.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She's generally kept under strict supervision, but one day ends up walking home from school on her own. This proves to be instant trouble when a group of boys start harassing her. Junichi Nagase, who was on his way home from a convenience store, sees the troubled Yuuhi and comes to her rescue. One of the boys recognized Junichi as the famed \"Geno Killer\" and they dash off. Yuuhi thanks Junichi and when she asked for his name, he just waves and leaves. Of course, he regrets trying to act cool in front of the beautiful girl right away, wishing he asked her name.\n\nThe following day, a transfer student joins Junichi's class – it's Yuuhi! She calls Junichi out as the \"Geno Killer\", the only name she remembers him by, and rumors about the two spread quickly. Matters are made worse when Junichi kisses Yuuhi due to a misunderstanding. And on top of all that, it turns out that Junichi is Yuuhi's fiancé!\n\nYuuhi doesn't see Junichi as someone worthy. But, she could not go against her father's wishes. The only thing that Yuuhi can do is live with Junichi in the house he shares with his little sister Minato, and prove that Junichi is not worthy to be her husband. Will she succeed in proving his unworthiness, or will she fall in love on the way?",

          "synopsis": "When the missing Zero Kiryuu returns to Cross Academy, Yuuki Cross is relieved to see him safe, but finds that Zero has changed in more ways than one. As a result of choices he made, Zero is plagued by visions, and he seeks to uncover the reason behind them—unaware that the answers may be much closer than he thinks.\n\nSoon Yuuki also begins to be tormented by ghastly hallucinations, and she seeks an explanation about her shrouded past from the only one who can provide clarity: Pureblood vampire Kaname Kuran, who is closest to her heart. But what will happen when the truth is finally revealed?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
