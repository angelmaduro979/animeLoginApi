Ryou and Akira catch up over the course of an afternoon that ends with them crashing a party at a nightclub. Initially uncomfortable with the environment, Akira is shocked when violence provokes some of the club's partygoers to transform into demonic monsters. He and Ryou are only saved from the encounter thanks to the intervention of a great demon known as Amon. Amon possesses Akira, and the two together form the powerful Devilman⁠—a being that, due to the influence of Akira's strong empathy for his fellow man, is resolved to keep the human race safe from the threats of demonkind.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In fact they are so strong that humans do not stand a chance against them in a fight. \n\nThe only thing strong enough to defeat a demon is another demon and it is trough this logic that Ryo Asuka hatches the plan to have his good-hearted friend Akira Fudo possessed by a demon. If a person is of pure of heart then he might be able to control the demon that posses him and thereby acquire power equal to a demon. After raising some hell in a club the plan works and Akira is possessed by the powerful demon known as Amon. \n\nNow Akira is humanities sole champion of justice against the hidden demon menace that has plagued humanity since the dawn of time.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

They failed then, but a Dr. Myunihausen (Munchausen?) tries again, through the manipulation of Nagumo's brother Takeaki. His goal? To have the Chojin replaced.\n\nAs Takeaki is injured in the approaching flight, Nagumo donates some of his blood to save his life, thus infusing Takeaki with the powers of the overfiend. And the results might be too much for Tokyo, perhaps even the overfiend himself, to bear.\n\n(Source: themanime.org)",

In order to protect the colonies and maintain law and order in the solar system, the Earth Federation Government (EFG) was created. Soon, many settlers started to resent the EFG's and its sphere of influence, straining the relationship between the central government and the colonies.\n\nWhile a strained peace was being forged between Earth and the colonies, a race of non-human creatures known as Deathcula invaded the System. Without provocation, they attacked the colonies and killed many of the colonists. The EFG quickly realized that the Deathcula were technologically superior and their forces were hopelessly matched. In order to have a chance at survival, Dr. Charles Louvre developed a transformable starship known as the Bismarck.\n\nKnowing that an advanced team of specialists were required to operate the Bismarck, four individuals came together and were charged with keeping the outer colonies safe from further Deathcula attacks.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

The city of Tokyo was no exception.\n\nThe economy of Japan is crippled from this disaster and the government is willing for anything to help revive the country. As a result, the Japanese government forms \"JESAS\", a military foundation that has evil intentions of controlling Japan's future. JESAS handles the dumping of nuclear wastes into outer space.\n\nTo insure their protection from other countries, JESAS has developed \"R.B.\" Robotic Weaponry, which is controlled by pilots with \"A.I. (Accurate Intuition)\". On the opposite side of the law is the \"Green Frontier\", a united protection agency that was formed by countries sharing the same beliefs, to save the Earth.\n\nFeaturing JESAS pilots Kanna and Kazuto and Green Frontier's Doota Kang and Mira Yu, these four youngsters will decide the fate of the Earth through love, friendship and the passion for their duty.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

She is soon turned away however. Determined to get on the island, Tia searches for a way past the fences that guard the entrance, as another stranger arrives on the island to take on a mysterious job. Someone has been killing the inhabitants of the island and has the ability to appear and disappear at will. Seems the sword 'Aihorn' has been stolen and the spirit that resides within it seeks vengenance on those who killed its master 50 years before.\n\nAs Tia makes her way inside the island, it becomes clear that both she, and the stranger, are after the sword Aihorn, hoping to bring to an end its bloody goal. But the sword has the ability to possess the person who wields it - putting Tia and the stranger at a great disadvantage.\n\nBased on the manga by Kohime Ohse, Tia and Grandeek will have to face their most difficult challenge yet...\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo)",

Their family employs countless magicians and other supernatural beings in order to send them out to help those who need magical assistance. As a leader, Itsuki now has to be tough, commanding, and reliable, but there's one problem, he's a coward. Also, in order to run a successful business, he must connect with his employees, which is more difficult than it seems due to his personality. But not only does he have to deal with his own employees, he also has to deal with those who threaten the family business.\n\n(Source: CrunchyRoll)",

          "synopsis": "It has been a year since Misako became Yosuke Amamiya's wife, but her new stepson Kazuhiko is still barely acknowledging her, let alone seeing her as a mother figure. However, there is a more pressing matter on her mind: when she is alone at home, she frequently receives menacing calls from a stranger possessing detailed knowledge of her day-to-day life. Unable to bring this issue up with Yosuke, she remains silent about these disturbing interactions.\n\nJust as Kazuhiko starts warming up to Misako, things take a darker turn when she gets a sex toy delivered to her door. Left unsatisfied by her workaholic husband, she begins to engage in a new pastime: masturbating while on the phone with the unknown speaker. One day, Misako realizes that she is not the only one with a dirty secret when she witnesses Kazuhiko pleasuring himself with her underwear! Now aware that her stepson thinks of her as a woman, where will all this sexual tension lead?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
