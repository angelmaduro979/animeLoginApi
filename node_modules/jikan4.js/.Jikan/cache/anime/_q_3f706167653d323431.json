Tezuka Production created anime specials for the event under the supervision of Osamu Tezuka. \"Bremen 4: Jigoku no Naka no Tenshi-tachi\" was produced for the 1981 event. Its title means \"Bremen 4: Angels in Hell\" in English.\n\nThe story is, similar to the Bremen Town Musicians fairy tale by Brothers Grimm, about four animals, Coda the cat, Alegro the dog, Largo the donkey and Minuet the chicken.\n\nThey save Rondo the alien who is on a peace mission. In return Rondo gives them a machine which can transform them into humans. Turned into their new form as humans, they go to the town, where they see the madness of war.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

          "synopsis": "In these jokey short films, many of them crudely animated, Kago's sick sense of humor reaches its full heights of absurdity. There's a playful surrealist sensibility to Kago's work, as well as a tendency to revel in the ridiculous, the crude and the disturbing. His work straddles a weird boundary between avant-garde experimentation and low-brow fart jokes—the punchline of one of these films is literally an oozing torrent of shit—although, admittedly, his videos seem to lean a bit more heavily towards the fart jokes than his comics. But hey, who doesn't appreciate a good fart joke once in a while?\n\n(Source: Only the Cinema blog)",

However, with the end of the war, there was nothing left for him but a peaceful Japan. In the meantime, \"Destruction Bombs\" are found in many places in Tokyo.

It happens every decade in an entirely new dimension, and those who have never run into each other can meet. And what's more, all individuals involved gain the opportunity to fulfill any of their wishes! However, they will have to come a long way, as they will need to partake in contests.\n\nIn Carnival Phantasm, various characters are put into situations that ridicule their own worlds. Nevertheless, they all have the same objective: to win the contests by any means necessary!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In the bustling and futuristic city of Heartland, a young boy named Yuuma Tsukumo has a dream that everyone his age wants to achieve—earning the title of the greatest duelist! Sadly, due to his lackluster dueling skills, this dream is far from achievable. But when the school bully, Ryouga \"Shark\" Kamishiro, splits the key given to him by his father into two pieces, he inadvertently sets Yuuma on a collision course with his dream.\n\nRetaining one half of the key, Yuuma begins a duel with Shark, but soon realizes that his inexperienced skills are no match for him. In a sudden turn of events, Yuuma's key repairs itself, and the \"Door of Destiny'' appears before him. Using the key to open it, Yuuma is greeted by an alien by the name of Astral—a being only he can see. \n\nThe bewildered Yuuma soon learns that his memories have been divided into 100 \"Number Cards,\" all of which he must retrieve. However, he is also not the only one looking for them. Bombarded by these revelations, Yuuma, alongside Astral, must defend the world from the upcoming threats that loom over Heartland City—regardless of any divine intervention that may occur. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Atop a hill overlooking a seaside port sits a boarding house named Coquelicot Manor. Since the building is run by her family, Umi Matsuzaki carries out many of the duties involved in managing the small establishment, such as preparing meals for her fellow boarders. When she isn't at home, she is a student at the local high school—one that is currently dealing with a small crisis.\n\nIn anticipation of the upcoming Olympic Games, a beloved old clubhouse is set to be demolished to make way for a modern building. As a result, a large part of the student body has banded together, working tirelessly to prevent this from happening. Umi finds herself helping the newspaper club to spread information about this cause where she befriends Shun Kazama, whom she gradually begins to fall in love with. But Shun is an orphan who doesn't know much about his origins, and when the two begin searching for clues to the boy's past, they discover that they may have a lot more in common than either of them could have thought.\n\n[Writtten by MAL Rewrite]",

For Mashiro, however, serialization is just the first step. Having promised to marry his childhood sweetheart and aspiring voice actress, Azuki Miho, once his manga gets an anime adaptation, Mashiro must continue his to popularize Ashirogi's work. A tremendously competitive cast of ambitious mangaka—including the wild genius, Eiji Niizuma; the elegant student, Yuriko Aoki, and her older admirer and partner, Takurou Nakai; the lazy prodigy, Kazuya Hiramaru; and the abrasive artist, Shinta Fukuda—both support and compete against Muto Ashirogi in creating the next big hit.\n\nAs they adjust to their young and seemingly untested new editor, the dynamic duo struggle to maintain their current serialization, secure the top spot in Shounen Jack, and ultimately, achieve an anime adaptation of their manga. With new rivals and friends, Bakuman. 2nd Season continues Takagi and Mashiro's inspiring story of hard work and young love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Actually, his deceased father worked on this theme and he now takes it over. One day, he submits a report, but it is thrown out soon. The theme of his report is, \"Women's current concerns attribute to their past mental conflicts, especially during adolescence. By removing their past mental concerns with hypnotism and making them experience a satisfying school life, their depression will be cured.\" \"It's just an armchair theory. No one will believe it.\" Nozomu gets upset and makes up his mind to prove it. Days later, he somehow collects three girls, Mirai, his mother, Kyouka, Mirai's friend, and Izumi, his old friend. Like this, his grand experiment involving \"married women in sailor's uniform\" starts....\n\n(Source: ErogeShop)",

          "synopsis": "This work was submitted in a special animation competition as part of a PR project for a power company, but was unfortunately not adopted. The reason is very clear: the setting of the story is the exhausted earth. There couldn't be a more instructive setting for a power company that uses enormous amounts of the earth's resources. Additionally, a girl robot discovered by the main character can store sunlight and convert it into energy; in other words, the robot does not require a power-generating company. In addition to this, the robot destroys herself to protect the established solar power generation system in space. \n\nThe unsuccessful outcome of the competition for Tezuka Osamu was only natural, and it is clear that he created this piece, as it was intentionally, as he managed everything from the original story to the screenplay, animation, narration, etc., all the while knowing that the competition was sponsored by a power company. \n\n(Source: tezukaosamu.net)",

          "synopsis": "Based on the romance manga \"Koiko no Mainichi \" by George Akiyama, serialized in Weekly Manga Goraku.\n\nIn a story that flits between serious drama and comedic farce, Shinjuku gangster Sabu and his young wife Koiko try to live a normal life, despite the interferences of gang politics and criminal deals. After she saves his life, Sabu's gang-boss, Tominaga, falls in love with Koiko, and sends Sabu into increasingly more dangerous situations, hoping to cause his arrest, and thus obligate himself to \"take care\" of Koiko while Sabu is in prison. \n\n(Source: Anime Mushi)",
