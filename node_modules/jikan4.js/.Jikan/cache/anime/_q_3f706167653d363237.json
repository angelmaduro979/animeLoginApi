Hoping to savor the sight of the peaceful ocean, Hina stumbles upon a girl named Yuuki Kuroiwa—an upperclassman at her new school—who invites Hina to join her in fishing. Hina reels in an octopus, which falls onto her; being afraid of bugs and big creatures, she panics and begs Yuuki to remove it from her. Yuuki sees this as an opportunity to force Hina to join the school's Breakwater Club—a club where members gather, catch, and eat various types of marine life as their main activity.\n\nAlthough her attempts to refuse to join fail, Hina slowly begins to discover the hidden joy in fishing. Her view on the sport changes, now looking forward to all the delightful experiences she can take part in alongside her fellow club members.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, she has given up on her future, seeing the prestigious school as nothing more than a prison from the outside world. Her family notices her struggling in her lessons and decides to hire Violet Evergarden to personally tutor her under the guise of a handmaiden. \n\nAt first, Isabella treats Violet coldly. Violet seems to be able to do everything perfectly, leading Isabella to assume that she was born with a silver spoon. After some time together, Isabella begins to realize that Violet has had her own struggles and starts to open up to her. Isabella soon reveals that she has lost contact with her beloved younger sister, Taylor Bartlett, whom she yearns to see again. \n\nHaving experienced the power of words through her past clientele, Violet asks if Isabella wishes to write a letter to Taylor. Will Violet be able to help Isabella convey her feelings to her long-lost sister?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But while heading home, the timid girl brightens up when she encounters a boy who looks exactly like her first love—a prince from a shoujo manga. Subsequently, she finds herself in a peculiar situation with the mature Akari Yamamoto, a new neighbor who immediately befriends her.\n\nNow attending the same high school together, Yuna shows interest in Akari's brother Rio—the same mysterious and handsome boy she met during spring break. Likewise, Akari is falling for Yuna's carefree childhood friend, Kazuomi Inui. However, love is not at anyone's fingertips, as the relationship between these four contrasting friends faces complications, preventing them from moving forward. To discover the truth between them, they will need to confront their own struggles and uncover secrets hidden among themselves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having been hurt by the only person he had ever fallen in love with, he now engages in strictly physical relationships.\n\nOne day, Yashiro's superior assigns Chikara Doumeki, a recently released prisoner, to the role of Yashiro's new bodyguard. The stoic and observant Doumeki is also clumsy and impotent, much to Yashiro's dismay. Although Yashiro has a personal policy to not get involved with his subordinates, he finds himself strangely drawn to Doumeki, who keeps denying his advances. Despite his refusals, Doumeki finds Yashiro beautiful and wishes to stay by his side, yet he knows that he will never be able to satisfy his boss. As the two grow closer, their complicated pasts slowly begin to reveal themselves. Will their histories get in the way of their emergent feelings?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Japan is about to celebrate the world's largest sports festival, \"WSG-World Sports Games\", in Tokyo. In line with the opening ceremony, it is announced that the world's first \"Vacuum Superconducting Linear\" train, boasting a maximum speed of 1,000 km/h which combined all of Japan's technologies, will be opened to the public between Shin-Nagoya Station and Shibahama Station and established in Tokyo. As the world's attention is garnered, an incident occurs at a party venue where famous tournament sponsors are gathered, leading to an abnormal situation where top dogs of companies are kidnapped one after another. Behind the scenes are Shuichi Akai who monitors the incident, and the FBI who waits for orders from Akai.\n\nConan's reasoning reveals the relevance of the apocalyptic WSG kidnapping incident that occurred in Boston, USA, fifteen years ago, and that the incident was also under the jurisdiction of the FBI. Is this a coincidence? What is going to happen in Japan, where many types of people from all over the world are gathered?\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)",

          "synopsis": "Through their tutor Fuutarou Uesugi's diligent guidance, the Nakano quintuplets' academic performance shows signs of improvement, even if their path to graduation is still rocky. However, as they continue to cause various situations that delay any actual tutoring, Fuutarou becomes increasingly involved with their personal lives, further complicating their relationship with each other.\n\nOn another note, Fuutarou slowly begins to realize the existence of a possible connection between him and the past he believes to have shared with one of the five girls. With everyone's feelings beginning to develop and overlap, will they be able to keep their bond strictly to that of a teacher and his students—or will it mature into something else entirely?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
