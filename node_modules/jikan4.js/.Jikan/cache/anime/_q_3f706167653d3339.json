When the elven priestess Celcia Marieclaire casts the spell to send them home, she is interrupted, and the spell is broken into parts that scatter throughout the world. The spell fragments imprint themselves onto the skin of various elves.\n\nThe trio travels in Ritsuko's tank, searching for elves who might carry the spell fragments so that Celcia can transfer them to her own body and make the spell whole again. As they adventure, people begin to refer to them as \"Those Who Hunt Elves,\" gaining a reputation as warriors that put a stop to evil-doers with their miraculous cannon, terrifying elves by stripping any that they find. Though they're not the smartest group, they make up for it with enthusiasm and their strong determination to get back to Japan.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Upon evaluating the casualties, two officers discover a winged girl lying unconscious in chains and attempt to resuscitate her. However, she barely awakens before a group of specialists wearing protective suits hastily takes her away.\n\nDisappointed to see the angel-like being end up in confinement again, the policemen resolve to set her free and start making the necessary preparations. Despite the need to infiltrate a restricted research facility, there is no stopping the duo from readily throwing themselves into a deadly rescue mission.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "On Your Mark is a music video created by Hayao Miyazaki for the pop music duo Chage and Aska, which he worked on as a side project during his production of Mononoke Hime. It is the director's first work combining digital and hand-drawn animation. Originally aired as part of the duo's SUPER BEST3 MISSION IMPOSSIBLE tour in June 1995, the video was later shown alongside screenings of Mimi wo Sumaseba in theaters. It was also presented at the Mononoke Hime screening event in the US—which commemorated the 20th anniversary of the film's release—in 2017. The video was made available on VHS and Laserdisc by Pony Canyon on July 25, 1997. It was later included in the Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short compilation DVD, released by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on November 16, 2005. Following the scandal of Aska being arrested for drug possession, Walt Disney Studios Japan removed On Your Mark from the Blu-ray and DVD box sets containing Hayao Miyazaki's works, which were released in July 2014, and also stopped the distribution of Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short. Studio Ghibli eventually decided to offer free individual Blu-rays of On Your Mark to all customers that had acquired box sets between October 2014 and October 2015. On Your Mark was later included in the expanded Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short 1992-2016 Blu-ray and DVD collections, made available by Walt Disney Japan Company on July 17, 2019.",

His timing is off and he seems to have no \"feel\" for the music.\n\nGauche returns to his lonely cottage and starts practicing. Then a cat enters who tricks him into understanding the inner meaning of the music. The importance of practice is shown by a cuckoo, rhythm by a badger and tenderness by a mouse. In four days he learns the true meaning and feeling of music and develops into a great musician.\n\nLaced with popular classical music this special combines fun and inspiration for all ages and audiences.\n\n(Source: AnimeNfo, edited)",

Maybe the original purpose of this story is to unravel the mysteries bound in this time and world. For the humans who found this vast rare multi-level city, the mysterious main character \"Kirii\" wanders to search for the \"Net Terminal Genes\" that were not infected. Kirii's burden and his search for the \"Net Terminal Genes\" is a goal like no other and is very much the mystery of this story. Log1~Log6 contains the story of Cibo that wasn't done in the original works. The Cibo who strayed away with Kirii and wanders about. A disc thrown away in the rubble. Cibo starts downloading. Just who's \"Memory\" will he end up with?\n\n(Source: AniDB)\n\nNote: These clips are meant as a bonus to the manga, and should only be taken as such. Do not expect any plot in these.

Kouji Kabuto and Tetsuya Tsurugi fight a fierce battle against these hellish machines, which are under the command of Baron Ashura. Unfortunately, they are defeated, with Kouji's Mazinger Z being captured and Tetsuya's Great Mazinger seriously damaged by the enemy.\n\nThe devious Dr. Hell quickly converts the captured robot into Ashura Mazinger and uses it to attack the Photo Power Lab. At the same time, Kouji is missing in action, which leaves Testuya to defend the lab in the damaged Great Mazinger. But the forces of Dr. Hell are too strong, even for a brave pilot such as Tetsuya, and all seems to be lost.\n\nThe battle seems to be drawing to a close, until an overpowering blast fired by an unknown robot destroys the entire Mechanical Beast army. Could this mysterious robot be the legendary Mazinkaiser, and who is piloting it?",

          "synopsis": "The story centers around three characters—Uesugi Kazuya, his twin older brother Tatsuya, and Asakura Minami. Kazuya is the darling of his town as he's talented, hardworking, and the ace pitcher for his middle school baseball team. Tatsuya is a hopeless slacker who's been living the life of giving up the spotlight to Kazuya, despite the fact that he may be more gifted than him. Minami is the beautiful childhood girlfriend and for all intents, sister from next door who treats both of them as equals. Society largely assumes Kazuya and Minami will become the perfect couple, including Tatsuya. Yet as time progresses, Tatsuya grows to realize that he's willing to sacrifice anything for the sake of his brother, except at the expense of giving up Minami to Kazuya. And thus the story is told of Tatsuya trying to prove himself over his established younger brother, how it affects the relationship between the three, and both brothers' attempts to make Minami's lifelong dreams come true.",
