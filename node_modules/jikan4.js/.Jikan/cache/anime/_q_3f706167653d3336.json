          "synopsis": "At the Ministry of Science, fervent Professor Ochanomizu alongside his coworkers strive to reactivate Atom—the first robot with a human heart. Atom is the masterpiece of enigmatic Professor Umatarou Tenma, who built the android to replace his deceased son Tobio. However, while Tenma inexplicably shut down his brainchild and disappeared, Ochanomizu refuses to let such a major breakthrough in science go to waste.\n\nDespite having the appearance of a nine-year-old, Atom not only possesses incredible strength and intelligence, but he is also endowed with a remarkable conscience and compassion that rivals humans. Sadly, the mechanical boy soon faces rejection and learns that not everyone is as welcoming as Ochanomizu. Although automatons have integrated into society, they are accepted only as tools and even seen as an upcoming threat to mankind's dominion.\n\nDreaming of a world where people and robots can prosper together, Atom dedicates his existence to protecting the lives of both and inspiring them to form genuine bonds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Astro Boy: Tetsuwan Atom was produced to celebrate Atom's birthday—on April 7, 2003—as well as the 40th anniversary of the original series. While it keeps Osamu Tezuka's art style, the remake features modernized animation and various new Western characters. The anime aired on Fuji TV in Japan; overseas, it was broadcasted on Animax and on local televisions such as Kids WB in North America and YTV in Canada. The series won the 2004 Tokyo Anime Award in the Television Category. In Japan, 13 DVD volumes were released between October 3, 2003 and October 1, 2004. In addition, four limited-edition DVD boxes were made available from December 5, 2003 to October 8, 2004. The boxes included: three discs, three postcards, an action figure, and a 16-page booklet. The first box exclusively contained three additional trading cards. In North America, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released a complete series DVD collection in 2005 and five single discs in 2009; Mill Creek Entertainment produced a complete series collection in 2015. Four episodes of the anime were included in the Pop Culture Bento Box DVD set released by Mill Creek Entertainment in 2019. The series was adapted into two video games produced by Sega titled Astro Boy: Omega Factor and Astro Boy. The former became available on August 17, 2004 for the Game Boy Advance while the latter was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004 in Japan and North America and in 2005 in Europe. Additionally, a clip named ROBOT - Yume no Astro Boy e, which presents actual robot technology with the digital animation of Atom, was screened at different science museums in Japan starting on April 15, 2004.",

One day, Rie comes across a dusty, hand-written book. Found on a sales pile in an antique shop, the manuscript seems to be nothing more than a foreign curiosity.\n\nUpon translating the book, the girls discover simple spells designed to bend an unsuspecting victim to the user's will and impose one's sexual desires on them. Realizing they have come into possession of a mighty weapon, the group begins fulfilling different requests of other students—be it for love, vengeance, or sexual desire. As the situation spirals out of control, the magic club gradually transforms into a cult of blood, lust, and human sacrifice.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Retro's wild antics and Pandy's carefree personality make them the perfect partners in crime to cause mayhem wherever they strike.\n\nWhen an accidental mistake lands them behind bars, Retro and Pandy are sent to Dead Leaves—a high-security prison on the Moon. Once there, they soon discover that the other inmates are clones, all products of genetic mutation experiments. With nothing better to do, they escape from their cell and lead a prison break with the other captives. Armed with a crew of mutants and a hunger for havoc, the chaotic duo begins their wacky escape.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "The overcrowding of Earth forced humanity to migrate to other planets and adapt accordingly. Spread across the solar system, the race continued to prosper—until Pluto was suddenly attacked by an unknown enemy. The complete annihilation of its population made clear the mysterious assailants' aim to destroy mankind. The invaders use their human victims' knowledge and energy to pilot giant mechanical bodies, and humanity has dubbed them Apocalypse out of fear.\n\nIn the year 2199, Second Lieutenant Jonathan Tyberius clears his screening tests and becomes qualified to undergo the most elite military training course—allowing him to develop the ability to pilot humanity’s own manned robots. Working through the tough military training, he gradually grows closer to his new roommate, Leonard Schteinberg.\n\nBeneath the facade of a disciplined army base, corruption runs deep. With a tyrannical predator calling the shots, and long-forgotten memories returning to haunt them, Jonathan and Leonard begin to suspect that their greatest enemy might not actually be the Apocalypse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They're the hottest new cosplay team in Japan...fresh from a winning streak of local battles, they're set to sweep the Cosplay World Series!\n\nYeah, right.\n\nIn reality, Chako and her friends are barely able to keep their club alive at all. Feeble club membership and a lack of sponsorship might be the end of their cosplay dreams before they can even start. But don't you dare underestimate this group of spunky girls! They'll survive a barrage of pervy newcomers, cosplay rivalries, costume disasters and dating mishaps in order to reach their ultimate goal of competing in the World Series. The clothing flies as the girls suit up (and strip down) for Cosplay Complex!\n\n(Source: DVD Back Cover)",
