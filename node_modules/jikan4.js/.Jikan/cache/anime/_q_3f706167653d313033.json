Without warning, Sanshirou is taken to a backwards universe to play BakéGyamon—a game pitting monsters against monsters. Along the way he meets other players who have a particular reason for being there—to obtain the wish that is granted to the winner. But how far can Sanshirou get when the monsters he's been paired with are a bunch of little mud balls?!\n\n(Source: VIZ Media)",

To combat this threat, Flame Hazes are tasked with saving humans from losing their existences. But while it is a Flame Haze's duty to protect humans, Shana—the \"Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter\"—seems to be focusing her attention on one human in particular: Yuuji Sakai, a teenage boy who was unwittingly dragged into the fight between Crimson Denizens and Flame Hazes. Since her first encounter with Yuuji, Shana has started to see him as more than just a friend. In fact, Yuuji wonders if Shana might have revealed her feelings to him once before, but it is difficult for him to confirm due to her hot-and-cold personality. Nonetheless, their days pass like any other, until a new transfer student arrives at their high school—one who bears a striking resemblance to an old enemy.\n\nYuuji and Shana have no time to dance around their feelings for each other; while their adversaries from the Bal Masqué organization plan their next attack, the two must keep their guard up as they explore the origin behind the coveted magical object within Yuuji's body, the \"Midnight Lost Child.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From the stratosphere come five beautiful nymphs in the shape of angels, bearing the fragrance of forbidden fruit. It appears their desire is to bring pleasure to the devastated human race. A young programmer working late spots one of the beautiful girls on his balcony, peeping on a couple across the way. Once she departs he is surprised to find the scent of fruit lingering in the air. He knows he must pursue her, what he is yet to discover is that she's not of this Earth! \n\n(Source: AniDB)",

          "synopsis": "In the distant future, on a dying Earth, human beings are synthetically produced and raised by artificial intelligence to hold specific roles in society. Among them lives Godo Shingo, a candid young cadet who demonstrates uncommon kindness toward living creatures and robots alike. Although Godo's superiors ridicule him for showing attachment to his nursemaid robot, Olga, he makes quite an impression as a sharpshooter and is entrusted with a special task—to capture the legendary immortal bird Phoenix, which has destroyed countless spaceships.\n\nHowever, his life changes dramatically after falling in love with Rena, the president's daughter who is also the fiancée of Rock Holmes—the Chief of the Science Department. After the pair fails to elope, they are separated, and Godo is sentenced to prison camp labor. Luckily for him, their companions Olga and Pincho—Rena's alien pet—escape unnoticed and come to his rescue. \n\nHi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone follows an engaging adventure in outer space, exploring the idea of selfless love as an unparalleled power.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
          "background": "Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone, the first anime adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's Hi no Tori manga series, is based very loosely on the themes and elements of primarily the \"Future\" and \"Resurrection\" volumes. The movie features iconic characters of Tezuka's various works, with certain designs such as the Phoenix's having at least three renditions. The methods employed for special effects in the movie include scan camera shots, CGI, live-action filming, \"2-frame photography,\" 3D manipulation, rotoscoping, and more. Re-titled Space Firebird, the anime was one of the most widely distributed of the videos that have found their way into the Bargain Bin. The English version was first seen on US television in 1982, but was cut down by 20 minutes. A few months later, it was released in the UK on VHS & Betamax by Mountain Video in the same format and widely publicized. However, the video disappeared from store shelves two years later and was never re-released by another distributor. In the US, it was issued as VHS only in 1987 from the popular Celebrity Just For Kids. While the dub was the same, the movie was 10 minutes shorter, omitting some sundry scenes and the end credits. In 1980, Hi no Tori 2772: Ai no CosmoZone won the Inkpot Award at the San Diego Comic Convention and the Animation Award at the first Las Vegas Film Festival. It was also nominated at the Saturn Awards for the best animated movie category in 1983.",

Due to Pluto's destruction, the asteroid, which is dubbed Thanatos, becomes temporarily stagnant. Now, in order to avoid Earth's impending destruction, the International Solarsystem Development Agency (ISDA) works on the \"D-Project\", and creates the \"Dragonaut\" after finding a dragon egg under the ocean. This weapon's primary purpose is to destroy the asteroid when the time comes. However, they soon find out that the asteroid is not their only threat, as powerful dragon-like creatures, which are bent on destruction, appear on Earth.\n\nAfter witnessing a murder by one of the creatures, Jin Kamishina, a lonely 18-year-old boy who lost his family in a shuttle accident two years ago, gets involved in the mysteries of the dragons and becomes the chosen pilot of the Dragonaut. Helping him on his journey is Toa, a mysterious girl who saves him from falling to his death after the creature attacks him. As they get deeper into the mysteries of the dragons, they encounter new friends and enemies, and also begin to develop a closer relationship. \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

He is innocent and blameless and always in a good mood. Afro Ken is always willing to try new things. Afro Ken is attracted to objects that look like he does. His hair changes to look like these things as he gets close to them.\n\nThere is an Afro Ken Family Tree with other dog characters who have outrageous names, such as Techno Ken, Funky Ken, Lord Ken, Super Afro Ken, and Normal Ken. Unlike the others, Normal Ken does not have wild hair.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",
