Most of her cases involve monsters infringing upon the rights of humans, who are protected by law from their generally more powerful neighbors. Being half-human and half cat-beast, Natsuki straddles the two societies and tries to understand and respect both while enforcing the law. She is assisted by a werewolf named Batanen who is afraid to admit he loves her; another werewolf named Tommy; and a Kyubi fox demon named Sakura who has her own plans--which include eating Natsuki to complete her her nine tails and thereby her magical powers. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

The victorious walk away with millions, and the defeated lose everything (namely, all their clothes).\n\nBut this high-stakes sport has dark forces and dubious practices behind the fun and games. Lethal injections make steroids seem like vitamins. Instead of team prayer, there's demonic possession. Athletic sponsors are malevolent corporations with a more frightening agenda than increased market share. It's all just part of the game.\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

The infamous \"training from Hell\" first tests the members as they run all the way up toward the mountainside club. Shortly after, they participate in specialized tennis practice that matches their specific playstyles. With the threat of Sadaharu Inui's new \"Marvelous Surprise Inui Juice Excellent\" awaiting any who fail to complete their daily tasks, the boys persevere through their exhaustion. \n\nA group of ill-mannered university students also arrive at the resort and demand to use the courts initially reserved for Seishun. Annoyed by their arrogance, Ryouma Echizen single-handedly challenges them to a match, with the winner claiming the right to the courts. Can the young freshman \"super rookie\" defeat the pompous team by himself?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But it is no normal game, as all who have played it have gone missing. Many whisper it is the work of demons, but that is just a rumor... or is it?\n\nKakurenbo follows the story of seven children as they play Otokoyo for the first time and discover why if you play, you never return.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Louise Françoise Le Blanc de La Vallière is a self-absorbed mage in a world of wands, cloaks, and royalty. Although she studies at Tristain Academy, a prestigious school for magicians, she has a major problem: Louise is unable to cast magic properly, earning her the nickname of \"Louise the Zero\" from her classmates.\n\nWhen the first year students are required to perform a summoning ritual, Louise's summoning results in a catastrophic explosion! Everyone deems this to be yet another failure, but when the smoke clears, a boy named Saito Hiraga appears. Now Louise's familiar, Saito is treated as a slave, forced to clean her clothes and eat off the ground. But when an unfamiliar brand is found etched on Saito's hand from the summoning ritual, it is believed to be the mark of a powerful familiar named Gandalfr.\n\nWild, adventurous, and explosive, Zero no Tsukaima follows Saito as he comes to terms with his new life and as Louise proves that there is more to her than her nickname suggests.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Toyotomi has allowed his rival, Tokugawa, to live but since that final battle an evil ayakashi named Yasha reveals to Tokugawa that history says that he should have won the war instead of Toyotomi. Tokugawa agrees to the evil ayakashi power Yasha offers him, and the only person who can stop Tokugawa from ruling Japan and killing Princess Kaguya, who is the link to this alternate present, is Musashi Miyamoto, a young and brash man who follows the way of \"Gun-do\", which mixes together swordfighting with gunplay.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

          "synopsis": "Time has come to a standstill. A whale appears from a glassy ocean and spends half a day soaring gracefully across the skies. What makes this works extraordinary is the artist's decision to use the transparency and visual bulk of 3D computer graphics only for the un-moving ocean and glaciers. The people, whale, and ships are all hand-drawn, and with this contrast, he invites the viewer into a different world. This is a poem written in animation, the creation of a true fantasy. This project was a considerable under taking, and the results are marvelous.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Miyazawa often used animals as the main characters in his stories and poems, and it is this technique that allows director Shoji Kawamori to recreate Miyazawa's fanciful land of Ihatov and use it as the backdrop for Miyazawa's life. Beautiful and affecting, Spring and Chaos is a fitting tribute to one of Japan's greatest writers.\n\n(Source: Rotten Tomatoes)",
