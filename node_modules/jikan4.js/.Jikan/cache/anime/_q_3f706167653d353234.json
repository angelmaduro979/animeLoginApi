Giving him the name Poupelle, Lubicchi is able to recreate a bond he lost when his father died to the tyranny of the Inquisitors—an oppressive force that aims to suppress outside knowledge and the town's true history. But their newfound relationship soon captures a lot of attention, and the threat of the Inquisitors and even the criticism of a few townspeople will test the duo's friendship. In spite of this, Poupelle has struck a particular chord with Lubicchi, and the two conspire to bring the truth to the surface and clear the chimney smoke that clouds the town's skies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Miki's bakery isn't getting business, and there is something missing from her desserts. Kazuki is working on a report related to curry for his company, but a coworker tells him he has the wrong approach to the project.

Meanwhile Miki and her friend also travel around the city to a fashion show, the same pachinko parlor, and a restaurant.\n\nAfter talking with his coworker, Kazuki remembers drawing a red sky as a child and not worrying that he was different from other people. Miki's friend tells her that people have to be brave to come up with original ideas. Miki then remembers a time when she watched her father shoveling snow as a child. At that time, her father told her that people have to do bothersome things in order to persevere through the struggle and accomplish something.\n\nMiki experiments with different recipes, and Kazuki does field research. After channeling their creativity and originality, they are both able to succeed in their professions. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Deluxe Fighter then shows up to eliminate both since there can't be a double amount of evil in the world. One Chancellor comes forward to reveal themselves as Ayumi Himekawa acting as the Chancellor. Then Deluxe Fighter unveils themselves as Maya Kitajima. Both women are rivals in the Glass no Kamen franchise and frequently one-up each other acting, which leaves the real Chancellor and Yoshida confused as to why the came to their compound and even more confused that (breaking the 4th wall for self-deprecating humor) DLE will be animating the new Glass no Kamen anime.",

However, he lost his life during the battle with the Sage Emperor and six deity-ranked beasts.\n\nHis soul was then brought back to when he was still 13 years old. Although he's the weakest in his class with the lowest talent, having only a red soul realm and a weak one at that, with the aid of the vast knowledge which he accumulated from his previous life, he decided to train faster than anyone could expect. He also decided to help those who died nobly in his previous life to train faster as well.\n\nHe aims to protect the city from the coming future of being devastated by demon beasts and the previous fate of ending up destroyed. He aims to protect his lover, friends, family and fellow citizens who died in the beast assault or its aftermath. And he aims to destroy the so-called Sacred family who arrogantly abandoned their duty and betrayed the city in his past life.\n\n(Source: Goodreads)",

There, she meets Ryou Kirishima, a beautiful, confident woman whom she quickly befriends. After leaving the mixer together, the two spend the night talking and drinking. But when an inebriated Shizuka ends up at Ryou's apartment, one thing leads to another, and she finds herself being seduced by her new friend. And what's more, Ryou is actually a crossdressing man!\n\nAfter a passion-filled night, Shizuka awakens to a note left by Ryou, promising more erotic moments between them later.

Among them are Mio Natsume, a girl burdened with lingering feelings; Hazuki Morikawa, a member of the concert band but distant from the others; and Haruto Souma, an athlete obsessed with baseball. Meanwhile, second-year student Ena Komiya seeks to revive the photography club to its former glory, refusing to let the organization be disbanded. Though this group lacks a strong connection with one another, their lives suddenly cross paths with the arrival of a third-year transfer student.\n\nWhile a transfer so close to graduation is unusual for most, it is business as usual for Eita Izumi. Due to his father's work, he has never been able to stay in one place for very long. But as luck would have it, their most recent relocation has returned Eita to his hometown for his final semester of high school. For better or worse, it also sparks the rekindling of old relationships left behind in the past.\n\nWith graduation already causing its own share of anxieties, Eita's sudden arrival brings these students' carefree days to an abrupt end. Long-forgotten memories, deeply buried emotions, and inspiring new passions—everything is brought to light in their bittersweet final semester.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The kingdom's only Princess, Mousse Bibi is soon going to ascend to the throne as the new Queen, however all she cared on her life is to taste various kinds of cakes and sweets. One day, Lyan, her royal adviser, set up a plan by making her suffer Aguesia. As she is shocked that she can no longer taste anything, he told her that the only way to cure her condition is to search for the legendary magic called Delicious Miracle. She immediately left the castle and venture outside, not knowing to her that Lyne is doing this to eradicate her.\n\nUpon her arrival at the town called Cake Village, she first met a denizen of the village named Mocha Dennis, who is very obsessed on his looks.
