The short on an outdoor screen near the main Yabaton shop and the main voice actor Fukushi Ochiai, who voices Buu-chan, will attend the premiere. \n\nThe short follows the shy and kind-hearted Buu-chan and his unusual family as they get into both slapstick and heartwarming situations. \n\nYabaton serves Nagoya's regionally famous street food, misokatsu, a pork cutlet in miso sauce, as well as other fried foods. The chain has many locations but its main shop is located is Yaba-cho in Nagoya city (specifically the Osu Shopping District) where it can be easily spotted thanks to its towering mascot. \n\n(Source: ANN)",

Jin Mazama is one of the few humans there, who also happens to vehemently hate animals from the bottom of his heart! One day, he stumbles upon the rowdy and assertive girl Ranka Ookami, a small \"lone wolf\" without a pack, who has not a single friend.\n\nThe desperate Ranka tries to invite Jin into joining her pack; Jin, who hates animals, naturally refuses. Amid this situation, Jin meets Hitomi Hino, a fellow human, and promptly becomes infatuated with her. After getting to know each other, the two decide to create a cooking club, and after a few bad-blooded misunderstandings, Ranka soon joins the club as well.\n\nThus begins the howl-some and howl-arious story of two normal humans; an adorable wolf; a cheerful koala; a sluggish, blonde sloth; and a feline with cattitude in their newfound club—in a story that teaches that friendship can be forged by creatures of different kinds.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Haru Yamato was never interested in futsal ever since the sport gained international fame 10 years ago. However, a chance to watch Japanese futsal player Tokinari Tennoji compete at the U-18 World Cup completely changed his perspective. When given the opportunity on his first day at Koyo Gakuen High School, Haru enthusiastically joins the futsal club.\n\nThere, he meets a variety of talented players including captain Toi Tsukioka, who was a part of the same U-18 team as Tennoji. Despite having a dynamic roster, the Koyo Futsal Club has a long way ahead when it comes to assembling a team that can stand up to powerhouse opponents—especially for Haru, who is a total beginner to the sport!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "Lee Myeongyi has lived his whole life with pneumothorax—a collapsed lung. He despises the attention he draws at school with his bouts of loud hyperventilating, extended coughing fits, and exemption from physical education as well as military service. Whether suffering through the curiosity or ire of his classmates, Myeongyi is left feeling like a complete outcast. However, the class president Han Seonho often shows Myeongyi kindness and understanding. With his friendly gestures and handsome looks, he becomes Myeongyi's first crush.\n\nNine years later, Myeongyi attends his high school reunion for only one reason: to see Han Seonho once again. He holds a tiny glimmer of hope about the other man's feelings for him—but after seeing the bright gold ring on Seonho's left hand and listening to their classmates' prying questions, that hope is quickly dashed. Excusing himself to go take a smoke, regardless of the state of his lungs, Myeongyi is followed outside by Seonho. Unexpectedly, that marks the beginning of their illicit love affair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

          "synopsis": "In the distant past, a war between humans and demons brought about widespread chaos and bloodshed. To put an end to this seemingly endless conflict, Demon King Anos Voldigoad willingly sacrificed his life, hoping to be reborn in a peaceful future.\n\nIn preparation for their king's return, the demon race created the Demon King Academy, an elite institution tasked with determining Anos' identity when he reawakens. He reincarnates two millennia later, but to his surprise, he soon learns that the level of magic in the world has drastically waned during his absence. Moreover, when he enrolls at the academy to reclaim his rightful title, he finds out that demonkind remembers him differently. His personality, his deeds, and even his legacy are all falsified—masked beneath the name of an impostor. This \"lack\" of common knowledge renders him the academy's outlier—a misfit never before seen in history.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, Anos remains unfazed. As he sets out to uncover those altering his glorious past, he takes it upon himself to make his descendants recognize that their ruler has finally returned.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In an effort to uncover the identity of this person, the United States of the North American Continent (USNA) dispatches the most powerful asset in its arsenal to Japan on a covert mission—the elite magician unit \"Stars\" and its commander, Angie Sirius.\n\nAt First High School, Tatsuya Shiba and his friends are having a farewell party for Shizuku Kitayama, who is leaving to study abroad in the USNA as part of an exchange program. In her place, the group welcomes the beautiful Angelina \"Lina\" Kudou Shields. Around the same time, Tatsuya is informed about the USNA's plan to uncover his true identity.\n\nElsewhere in Tokyo, numerous reports arise of seemingly random bodies found drained of blood. Dubbed as the works of a vampire, it does not take long for Tatsuya to connect the dots and realize that it is almost impossible for the timing of these events to be mere coincidence.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Alongside Mutsuko Sakura, his classmate from elementary school, he aims to lead the team to glory. However, due to unexpected circumstances, Fuurin's baseball team is left with only six members: Daigo, Mutsuko, Yayoi Sawa, Tao Sagara, Seira Kandori, and Hiromu Tanba. Left with mostly female players and lacking in experience, the team struggles to gain confidence and trust from the new recruits—Akira Nishina, Anita Kabashima, and Chisato Fujii. Facing challenges such as having no proper coach, problematic recruits, and a limited number of members, Daigo's resolution is put to the test as he tries to bring the team together in time to participate in their first ever tournament.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As he searches the place, he discovers a smartphone with the popular digital card game \"Shadowverse\" already installed. Under the assumption that his grandfather has finally decided to buy him a smartphone after countless requests, Hiiro finds nothing amiss. \n\nLater that day, Hiiro receives concerning news regarding his classmate, Mimori Amamiya. She has lost as yet another victim of Takuma Kibakura, a fellow Shadowverse player who bullies his opponents by seizing their phones after he defeats them in battle. Determined to retrieve Mimori's smartphone, Hiiro enters an exciting new world, filled with intense matches and fierce Shadowverse opponents—including the formidable Lucia Yonazuki. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Heartbroken and drunk after a night out, she rants about her misery to a complete stranger—Kanetsugu Matou, a radio station director local to Sapporo, Hokkaido.\n\nThe next day at work, Minare is shocked to hear a recording of herself from the previous night playing over the radio. Flustered, she rushes to the radio station in a frenzy to stop the broadcast. As she confronts Matou, a chain of events leads to her giving an impromptu talk live on air, explaining her savage drunken speech. With her energetic voice, she delivers a smooth dialogue with no hesitation, which Matou recognizes as raw talent.\n\nMinare soon becomes a late-night talk show host under Matou's direction, covering amusing narratives set in Sapporo, all while balancing her day job and personal life to make ends meet.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their daughter Ayumu has just finished her track practice while their son Gou is playing video games at home. However, life as they know it is flipped upside down when a calamitous earthquake strikes the entire Japanese archipelago—obliterating the face of the country in an instant.\n\nWith society crumbling around them and their nation gradually sinking into the ocean, the Mutou family must band together to survive the catastrophe. Treading the near-apocalyptic setting, they struggle not only to stay alive, but also to learn the difficulty of coping with loss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
