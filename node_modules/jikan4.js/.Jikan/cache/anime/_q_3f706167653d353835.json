Here, both the wandering knight, Bedivere, and Chaldea’s own expedition find the Sixth Singularity. The residents of this desolate land have been driven from their homes as three opposing powers battle for control of the land.\n\nBedivere and company seek the help of the Mountain People to rise up against the Lion King and the Knights of the Round Table and combat their slaughter of innocents. After a deadly struggle and the loss of a dear friend, the group approaches Ozymandias, the Sun King, whose incredible power could help them turn the tables. In the halls of this great pharaoh, they desperately seek an alliance. Ozymandias, however, reveals the Lion King’s plans and refuses to assist in foiling them, instead wishing to protect his own people.\n\nShaken to their core by the revelation of the Lion King’s true intentions, Bedivere and the Chaldean expedition decide to mount an attack on Camelot itself, hoping to put an end to the Lion King’s schemes.\n\nAt last, the day of the final battle in the Holy City arrives.\n\nWhat are the true intentions of the Lion King, who has become so cold-blooded and diabolical?\nHow can humanity be saved from a world where ruin has been already promised?\nWhat will become of Bedivere after shouldering the burden of a sin that can never be pardoned?\n\n(Source: Official Website)",

Though united by this innate responsibility, each one has already started to take their first steps toward a future beyond being a Chosen Child. \n\nHowever, this new journey is interrupted by the appearance of Menoa Bellucci, an American professor specializing in Digimon research. She bears news of several Chosen Children from around the world being found comatose, with their partner Digimon nowhere to be found. Menoa's investigations indicate that a new breed of Digimon is behind the alarming phenomenon: Eosmon, who hides within the internet's depths. \n\nTo succeed in this mission, the team must endeavor through the growing distance between them and band together one last time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The video features a song completely in English with Japanese subtitles. As stated by the company president, Takahisa Takahara, is that women spend 6 yrs and 9 months menstruating their entire lives. With advancing gender roles and longer lifespans, more women are staying in the work place and having more periods. Mensuration causes hormonal mood swings like that of a cranky edgy prickly hedgehog, starving craving hungry black bear, fragile crying [bloated] elephant, and reclusive lonely lion. These are normal changes and the women are still themselves. It promotes body positivity and how women shouldn't be brushed off in the work place if they are having an effect from a biological function that they have to go through for 6 yrs and 9 months.",

The anime was made in honor of the 150th anniversary of the Meiji Restoration.\n \nIt stars Sakamoto Ryouma, a historical figure who took part in overthrowing the Tokugawa shogunate. He spent most of his youth in Shinagawa under the Tosa Clan residence and a statue of him was erected in his honor. He's considered a hero of Edo and worked as a cost guard/battery staff when Commodore Perry landed in Japan with black ships.\n\nHere, the anime has a young Ryouma encounter Kurofune-kun, a black ship chibi mascot, as they time slip to modern Shinagawa. Kurofune-kun shows him the sights and they meet other historical figures who time slipped.",

His standoffish personality and reclusive nature have left him friendless, and his father is debt-ridden, forcing his family to scrape by.\n\nOne day during his lunch break, Uesugi argues with a female transfer student who has claimed \"his seat,\" leading both of them to dislike each other. That same day, he is presented with a golden opportunity to clear his family's debt: a private tutoring gig for a wealthy family's daughter, with a wage of five times the market price. He accepts the proposal, but is horrified to discover that the client, Itsuki Nakano, is the girl he confronted earlier! \n\nAfter unsuccessfully trying to get back on Itsuki's good side, Uesugi finds out that his problems don't end there: Itsuki is actually a quintuplet, so in addition to her, he must also tutor her sisters—Miku, Yotsuba, Nino, and Ichika—who, despite the very real threat of flunking, want nothing to do with a tutor. However, his family's livelihood is on the line so Uesugi pushes on, adamant in his resolve to rid the sisters of their detest for studying and successfully lead them to graduation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The MV uses imagery to reflect the TV anime's theme of ghost sweeping and also splices in some live-action shots of the Oresama duo themselves. Unlike the first 3 music videos of their career, with character designs and animation solely done by Utomaru, this music video employed 26 other artists and animators to achieve the final product.\n\nThe song will be on their 6th single under the same title going on sale August 22nd, 2018.",
